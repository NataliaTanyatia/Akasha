# **Terence McKenna On Alchemy & The Hermetic Corpus ~ May 1991 ~ workshop**

Well, it is a small group, and this was my intent. By focusing on the hermetic corpus and alchemy, I've just gotten tired of talking about psychedelic drugs and always saying the same things over and over again. Nevertheless, it's a challenge to go outside my own bailiwick. I mean, I've had an interest in hermeticism and alchemy since I was about 14 and read Jung's Psychology and Alchemy, and it opened for me the fact of the existence of this vast literature, a literature that is very little read or understood in the modern context. The Jungians have made much of it, but to their own purposes and perhaps not always with the complete fidelity to the intent of the tradition. We'll talk a lot about the Jungian approach, but there are other approaches even within the 20th century. I believe, since I don't have the catalogue, I'm not absolutely certain, but I believe the catalogue urged you to read Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition by Dame Frances Yates. And this is, though Frances Yates' scholarship is very controversial, I think to get an overview of the landscape, her book is probably the best single book between covers. It's not pleasing to some factions, and we can talk about that. I mean, we will probably discover within the group all the strains of alchemical illusion and delusion that have always driven this particular intellectual engine. But I thought to get one book that sort of covered the territory, that was a good one to start with. Well, then I found out it's very hard to get this book. I didn't realize that because it's been sitting on my shelf for years. Richard Berg found a reprint at the Bodhi Tree that I wasn't aware of this particular edition. So, though probably none of you brought it with you in a heavily underlined form, if after this weekend you want to try and get it, it is available. And if you can't get that edition, why, a good book search service can probably come up with the first edition, which is Routledge, Keegan-Paul. I wouldn't hold a weekend like this simply to go over a body of ancient literature if I didn't think it had some efficacy or import for the modern dilemma. And some of you may know the song by the Grateful Dead in which the refrain is, We need a miracle every day. I think any reasonable person can conclude that the redemption of the world, if it's to be achieved, can only be achieved through magic. It's too late for science. It's too late for hortatory politics. Well, it's very interesting. I mean, every ancient literature has its apocalypsus. And in the Hermetic literature, there is a prophecy. I think it's in book two, but that really doesn't matter. And the prophecy is that a day will come when men will no longer care for the earth. And at that day, the gods will depart and everything will be thrown into primal chaos. And this prophecy was very strongly in the minds of the strains of non-Christian thought that evolved at the close, the centuries of closure of the Roman Empire. When you look back into historical time, it's when you reach the first and second centuries after Christ that you reach a world whose psychology was very much like the psychology of our own time. It was a psychology of despair and exhaustion. This is because Greek science, which had evolved under the aegis of democracy and atomism and platonic metaphysics, had essentially come to a dead end in those centuries. We can debate the reasons why this happened. An obvious suggestion would be that it was because they failed to develop an experimental method. And so everything just dissolved into competing schools of philosophical speculation, and a profound pessimism spread through the Hellenistic world. And out of that pessimism and in the context of that kind of universal despair which attends the dissolution of great empires, a literature was created from the 1st to the 4th centuries after Christ, which we call the Hermetic Corpus, or in some cases the Trismegistic Hymns. Now, this body of literature was misunderstood by later centuries, especially the Renaissance, because it was taken at face value and assumed to be at least contemporary with Moses, if not much older. So the Renaissance view of Hermeticism was based on a tragic misunderstanding of the true antiquity of this material. And there are people, hopefully none in this room, who still would have us believe that this literature antedates the Mosaic Law, that it is as old as dynastic Egypt. But this is an indefensible position from my point of view. In the early 16th century, two father and son, Isaac and Marit Casabon, showed through the new science of philology that this material was in fact late Hellenistic. Now, I've always said that I am not a classicist in the Viconian sense, in the sense that there is a certain strain of thought that always wants to believe that the oldest stuff is the best stuff. This is not the case, to my mind. To my mind, what is amazing is how recent everything is. So I have no sympathy with the fans of Lost Atlantis or any of that kind of malarkey, because to me what is amazing is how it all is less than 10,000 years old. Anything older than 10,000 years puts us into the realm of an aceramic society relying on chipped flint for its primary technology. What the Hermetic Corpus is, is the most poetic and cleanly expressed outpouring of ancient knowledge that we possess. But it was reworked in the hands of these late Hellenistic peoples. And it is essentially a religion of the redemption of the earth through magic. It has great debt to a tradition called Sabian, which means to me Manicheanism. I'm sorry, Mandaeanism. And Mandaeanism was a kind of proto-Hellenistic gnosis that laid great stress on the power of life, Zoa, bios. And in that sense it has a tremendously contemporary ring to it. We also are living in the twilight of a great empire. And I don't particularly mean the American empire. I mean the empire of European thinking created in the wake of the Protestant Reformation and the rise of modern industrialism. The empire, in short, of science. Science has exhausted itself and become mere techne. It's still able to perform its magical tricks, but it has no claim on a metaphysic with any meaning because the program of rational understanding that was pursued by science has pushed so deeply into the phenomenon of nature that the internal contradictions of the method are now exposed for all to see. And in discussing alchemy especially, we will meet with the concept of the coincidencia oppositorum, the union of opposites. This is an idea that is completely alien to science. It's the idea that nothing can be understood unless it is simultaneously viewed as both being what it is and what it is not. And in alchemical symbolism we will meet again and again symbolic expression of the coincidencia oppositorum. It may be in the form of a hermaphrodite. It may be in the form of the union of Sol and Luna. It may be in the form of the union of Mercury with Lead or with Sulfur. In other words, alchemical thinking is thinking that is always antithetical, always holds the possibility of by a mere shift of perspective its opposite premise will gain power and come into focus. I think it was John, when we went around the circle, mentioned his interest in shamanism. There's a wonderful book called The Forge and the Crucible by Mircea Leon in which he shows that the shaman is the brother of the smith. The smith is the metallurgist, the worker in metals. And this is where alchemy has its roots. In a sense, alchemy is older than the trismegistic corpus and then it is also given a new lease on life by the philosophical underpinnings which the Corpus Hermeticum provides it. The word alchemy can be traced back to mean Egypt or blackening. And in its earliest strata, it probably refers to techniques of dyeing, meaning the coloring of cloth, and gilding of metals, and the forging and working of metal. I mean, we who take this for granted have no idea how mysterious and powerful this seemed to ancient people. And in fact, it would seem so to us if we had anything to do with it. I mean, how many of us are welders or casters of metal? It's a magical process to take, for instance, cinnabar, a red soft ore, and by the mere act of heating it in a furnace, it will sweat liquid mercury onto its surface. Well, we have unconsciously imbibed the ontology of science where we have mind firmly separated out from the world. We take this for granted. It's effortless because it's the ambiance of the civilization that we've been born into. But in an earlier age, and some writers would say a more naive age, but I wonder about that, but in an earlier age, mind and matter were seen to be alloyed together throughout nature so that the sweating of mercury out of cinnabar is not a material process. It's a process in which the mind and the observations of the metal worker maintain an important role. And let's talk for a moment about mercury because the spirit Mercurius is almost the patron deity of alchemy. You all know what mercury looks like. It's at room temperature, a silvery liquid that flows. It's like a mirror. For the alchemists, and this is just a very short exercise in alchemical thinking, for the alchemists, mercury was mind itself in a sense. And by tracing through the steps by which they reached that conclusion, you can have a taste of what alchemical thinking was about. Mercury takes the form of its container. If I pour mercury into a cup, it takes the shape of the cup. If I pour it into a test tube, it takes the shape of the test tube. This taking the shape of its container is a quality of mind, and yet here it is, present in a flowing silvery metal. The other thing is, mercury is a reflecting surface. You never see mercury. What you see is the world that surrounds it, which is perfectly reflected in its surface, like a moving mirror, you see. And then if you've ever, as a child, I mean I have no idea how toxic this process is, but I spent a lot of time as a child hounding my grandfather for his hearing aid batteries, which I would then smash with a hammer and get the mercury out and collect it in little bottles and carry it around with me. Well, the wonderful thing about mercury is when you pour it out on a surface and it beads up, then each bead of mercury becomes a little microcosm of the world, and yet the mercury flows back together into a unity. Well, as a child, you see, I had not yet imbibed the assumptions and the ontology of science. I was functioning as an alchemist. For me, mercury was this fascinating, magical substance onto which I could project the contents of my mind. And a child playing with mercury is an alchemist, hard at work, no doubt about it. Well, so then, this is a phenomenon in the physical world, and then mind is a phenomenon as in the Cartesian distinction, which is between the res extensa and the res virens. This is the great splitting of the world into two parts. I remember Al Wong once said to me, we were talking about the yin-yang symbol, and he said, you know, the interesting thing is not the yin or the yang. The interesting thing is the S-shaped surface which runs between them, and that S-shaped surface is a river of alchemical mercury. Now, where the alchemist saw this river of alchemical mercury is in the boundary between waking and sleeping. There is a place, not quite sleeping, not quite waking, and there there flows this river of alchemical mercury where you can project the contents of the unconscious and you can read it back to yourself. This kind of thinking is confounding to scientific thought where the effort is always to fix everything into a given identity and a given set of behaviors. Now, the other hermetic perception that is well illustrated by just thinking for a moment about mercury is the notion, and this is central to all hermetic thinking, of the microcosm and the macrocosm. That somehow the great world, the whole of the cosmos, is reflected in the mystery of man, of man, meaning men and women. It's reflected in the mystery of the human mind-body interface. So, for an alchemist, it makes perfect sense to extrapolate from these internal, what we call internal psychological processes, to external processes in the world. That distinction doesn't exist for the alchemist. And I tell you, the longer I live, the more convinced I am that this is just absolutely the truth. Our, the myth of our society is the existential myth, that we are cast into matter, that we are lost in a universe that has no meaning for us, that we must make our meaning, this is what Sartre and Kierkegaard, all those people are saying, that we must make our meaning. It reaches its most absurd expression in Sartre's statement that nature is mute. I mean, this is as far from alchemical thinking as you can possibly get, because for the alchemist, nature was a great book, an open book to be read by putting nature through processes which revealed not only its inner mechanics, but the inner mechanics of the artifacts, the person working upon the material, in other words, the alchemist. Well, in other contexts, I've talked about the importance of language, and how our world is made of language, and part of the problem with understanding alchemy is that the language is slipping out of our reach. We are so completely imbued with the Cartesian categories of the res virens, the world of thought, and the res expenses, the world of three-dimensional space, and causality, and the conservation of matter and energy, and so forth, that in order to do more than carry out a kind of scholarship of alchemy, we have to create an alchemical language, or a field in which alchemical language can take place. Some of you may have been with me a couple of weeks ago in Malibu when Joan Halifax and I debated the roots of Buddhism, and I think Joan deserves great credit for saying that Buddhism would never have taken root in America were it not for the psychedelic phenomenon, not that Buddhism is psychedelic, it in fact is fairly touchy about that, but Buddhism would have gotten nowhere in America had not psychedelics created a context for Buddhist language to take root. And I would wager that I would never have gotten to first base with proposing a weekend on alchemy at Esalen were it not understood that psychedelics have prepared people for the notion that mind and world can be poured together like mercury and sulfur, like the sulphic waters, to create a new kind of understanding, because otherwise modernity has fixed our minds in the categories of Cartesian rationalism. And so I will not claim, and do not in fact think it's so, that there was anything overtly psychedelic in the sense of pharmacologically based about alchemy. When we look back through the alchemical literature, there's very little evidence that it was pharmacologically driven. Only when you get to the very last adumbrations of the alchemical impulse in someone like Paracelsus do you get the use of opium, but it is interesting that the great drugs of modern society were accidentally discovered by alchemists in their researches. Distilled alcohol is a product of alchemical work, and then, as I mentioned, opium was very heavily used by the Paracelsus school, but what they possessed was an ability to liquefy their mental categories and then to project the contents of the mind onto these processes and read them back. Now this is what made alchemy so fascinating to the Jungian school, because the Jungians were discovering the unconscious, and they realized before Jung's involvement with alchemy, the best material for psychotherapy to work upon was dreams, and mythology, and these were the two poles of the data field that the discovery of the unconscious was working on. Well, then Jung had the prescience to realize that alchemy, which to that point, as the gentleman over here said, had been dismissed as a naive effort to turn base metals into gold. This is the first fiction that you have to absolutely purge from your mind. The only alchemists that ever tried to turn base metals into gold were charlatans, the so-called puffers, because they were called that not only for their exaggerated speech, but for their use of bellows to drive their fires, and alchemy has always had a core of true agnets, and then a surround of misguided souls and outright con-artists who were trying to change base metals into gold. Now it's interesting that science, in its naivete, in the 20th century has actually completed the program of pseudo-alchemy. You can, if you have a sufficiently powerful nuclear reactor, change lead into gold. I mean, the cost is staggering. It has no economic importance whatsoever, but it can be done by bombarding gold with a sufficient amount of heavy particles. I mean, lead, you can change it into gold, but this is not what the original intent was. In fact, when we look at the history of 20th century science, we will see that in a way it's a misunderstanding of what the alchemical goals were to be, and one by one it has done these things that were the stated goals of the alchemists, except that the alchemists always spoke in similes, and in a secret control language that was symbolic... Okay... Now, another point that was brought up was, in going around the circle, was the externalization of the soul, and what we're trying to do is, in this weekend, is study and talk about the idea of redeeming the world through magic, and how is this to be done. Well, the Philosopher's Stone is a complex of ideas that, no matter how you divide it, no matter how you slice it, it's very difficult to hold the pith essence of this concept, but what it really comes down to is the idea that spirit is somehow resident in matter in a very diffuse form, and that the goal of chromatic thinking and later alchemy is the concentration and redemption of this spirit, a focusing of it, a bringing of it together. This is an idea that was common in the Hellenistic world, not only to hermetic thinking, but also to Gnosticism. Gnosticism is the idea that somehow the pure, holy, real light of being was scattered through a universe of darkness and of saturnine power, and that the goal is, by a process which we can call yogic or alchemical or meditative or moral /(slash)/ ethical, the light must be gathered and concentrated in the body and then somehow released and redeemed, and all esoteric traditions, East and West, talk about the creation of this body of light, and we will not in this weekend talk very much about alchemy, non-Western alchemy, Taoist alchemy, and Vedic alchemy, but in those systems, too, the notion is about the creation of this, Merkaba, vehicle of light. This is one metaphor for the externalization of the soul. The Philosopher's Stone is another, and I will challenge you to try to imagine what the achievement of the Philosopher's Stone would be like, because it's in trying to think that way that you begin to dissolve the categories of the Cartesian trap. And so imagine for a moment an object, a material, which can literally do anything. It can move across categorical boundaries with no difficulty whatsoever. So what do I mean? I mean that if you possessed the Philosopher's Stone and you were hungry, you could eat it. If you needed to go somewhere, you could spread it out and sit on it, and it would take you there. If you needed a piece of information, it would become the equivalent of a computer screen, and it would tell you things. If you needed a companion, it would talk to you. In other words, if you needed to take a shower, you would hold it over your head and water would pour out of it. Now you see, this is an impossibility. That's right. It's a coincidencia positorum. It is something which behaves like imagination and matter, without ever doing damage to the ontological status of one or the other. Now this sounds like pure pathology in the context of modern thinking, because we expect things to stay still and be what they are and undergo the growth and degradation that is inimical to them. But no, the redemption of spirit and matter means the exteriorization of the human soul and the interiorization of the human body so that it is an image freely commanded in the imagination. Imagination. I think this is the first time I've used this word this evening. The imagination is central to the alchemical opus, because it is literally a process which goes on in the realm of the imagination, taken to be a physical dimension. And I think that we cannot understand the history that lies ahead of us unless we think in terms of a journey into the imagination. We have exhausted the world of three-dimensional space. We are polluting it, we are overpopulating it, we are using it up. Somehow the redemption of the human enterprise lies in the dimension of the imagination. And to do that we have to transcend the categories that we inherit from a thousand years of science and Christianity and rationalism. And we have to re-empower and re-encounter the mind. And we can do this psychedelically, we can do it yogically, or we can do it alchemically and hermetically. Now there is present in the world at the moment, or at least I like to think so, an impulse which I have named the archaic revival. What happens is that whenever a society really gets in trouble, and you can use this in your own life, when you really get in trouble, what you should do is say, what did I believe in the last sane moment that I experienced? And then go back to that moment and act from it, even if you no longer believe it. Now in the Renaissance this happened, that the scholastic universe dissolved. New classes, new forms of wealth, new systems of navigation, new scientific tools, made it impossible to maintain the fiction of the medieval cosmology. And there was a sense that the world was dissolving, good alchemical word, dissolving. And in that moment the movers and shakers of that civilization reached backwards in time to the last sane moment they had ever known, and they discovered that it was classical Greece. And they invented classicism in the 15th and 16th century. The texts which had lain in monasteries in Syria and Asia Minor, forgotten and untranslated for centuries, were brought to the Florentine council by people like Gemistus Plesso and others, and translated, and classicism was born. Its laws, its philosophy, its aesthetics, and we are the inheritors of that tradition. But it is now once again exhausted, and our cultural crisis is much greater. It is global, it is total, it involves every man, woman, and child on this planet, every bug, bird, and tree is caught up in the cultural crisis that we have engendered. Our ideas are exhausted, the ideas that we inherit out of Christianity and its half-brother science, or its bastard child science. So what I'm suggesting is that an archaic revival needs to take place, and it seems to be well in hand in the form of the revival of goddess worship, and shamanism, and partnership. But notice that these things are old, 10,000 years or more old. But there was an unbroken thread that, however thinly drawn, persists right up to the present. So the idea of this weekend is to show the way back to the high magic of the late Paleolithic, to show that there were intellectual traditions, there were minority points of view that kept the faith, that never allowed it to die. And to my mind, this alchemical, hermetic, Gnostic, Egyptian, Chaldean thread is the thread. And if we unravel it with sufficient care and attention, then we can build a bridge from the otherwise nearly incomprehensible high magic of the late Paleolithic. We can get it as near to ourselves as John Dee, who died in 1604. We can discover that it's no further away from us than the beginning of the Thirty Years' War. And, you know, for my money, after that, it gets pretty mucked up. I mean, after Eliaphus Levy, who's already waffling, I'm not very interested in the occultism of the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. But it's not necessary, because scholarship gives us the Chaldean oracles, the Trismegistic hymns, the library at Nag Hammadi, and so forth and so on. So my impulse is to, in the most austere sense, repopularize, reintroduce this kind of thinking, so that people can live it out. And then, step by step, we can evolve our language and evolve our understanding to make our way back to the Garden, back to Eden. It's occurred to me recently, you know, it's said that Christ opened the doors to Paradise. Yes, but he closed the doors to Eden. And Paradise is a very airy place, where everybody sits around on clouds, strumming their lyres. I think what we want to do is make our way back to the alchemical Garden. That's where our roots are. That's where meaning is. Meaning lies in the confrontation of contradiction. The coincidencia oppositorum. That's what we really feel. Not these rational schemas that are constantly beating us over the head with the thou shalt and thou shoulds, but rather a recovery of the real ambiguity of being, an ability to see ourselves as at once powerful and weak, noble and ignoble, future-oriented, past-facing. We each need to become Janus-faced and to incorporate into ourselves the banished contradictions of being that so haunt the enterprise of science. We can leave that behind, and when we do, we reclaim authentic being.And authentic being, make no mistake about it, is what alchemical gold really is. That's what they're talking about. Authentic being. So that's tonight. Right now what? We're led. We're led. We're Saturnine, and we'll talk about Saturn and Pluto and all of that. Yes, tomorrow we'll talk about the stages of the alchemical opus, and though the stages are many and multifarious, it all begins in what is called the negredo, the blackening, the depths of the leaden, Saturnine, chaotic, fixed place. And that's where we have been left by science and modernity and so forth and so on. And that's where the alchemist loves to begin. That's where he then stokes, he or she stokes the furnace and begins the dissolution et coagulation that leads to the appearance of the stone. I'll show you some books. And this is, you know, by no means exhaustive. The literature of hermeticism and alchemy is vast, and I could have brought five or six books, boxes of this size from my own library. And this is a smattering. It doesn't mean what I show you is the best. It simply tries to spread over a large area. Oh, someone put this here. This is a new novel that's just been published by Lindsay Clark called The Chemical Wedding. And I see last week it was number 10 on the New York Times bestseller list, which is astonishing for such an obscure subject. It's a retelling of a famous incident in alchemy in the 19th century when a woman named Mary Alice Atwood, who had a very, very close relationship to her father, Dr. South. And the two of them worked together, she on a text and he on a long poem. And to make a long story short, eventually they decided to destroy both the poem and the book, feeling that they had said too much and had given the secret away. At least that's one version. So this is a fictionalized retelling of that incident, intercut with a modern cast of characters, very clearly modeled on the poet Robert Graves. So if you like to absorb your information in a fictionalized form, this is a wonderful book. John Borman, the movie director, recently auctioned this book, The Guy Who Made the Emerald Forest an Excalibur. So we may have an alchemical movie downstream a year or two. A number of compendiums of alchemical texts have been published over the centuries. And if you wish to study alchemy, you have to obtain these. If you're fortunate enough to read French, you should read Vestugiere and Berthelot. They collected alchemical texts into encyclopedic-sized volumes, but unfortunately these have never really come into English. One that did come into English is the Museum Hermeticum Amplificarum et Theatrum, I think, which A.E. Waite, who some of you may know for his role in The Golden Dawn, collected. There are about 40 alchemical texts, and all the greats are in here. Lowe, Villanueva, Michael Meyer, Basil Valentine, Kramer, Edward Kelly, and so forth. The place to begin, I think, is obviously with the question, who is Hermes Trismegistus? What are we talking about here? I mean, this sounds so incredibly exotic to people. The Renaissance had the concept of what it called the Preschi Theologi. And if my Latin and Greek irritates you, you have to understand you're dealing with a boy from a coal mining town in Colorado. So I do mangle these things. The Preschi Theologi were Orpheus, Moses, and primarily Hermes Trismegistus. Hermes Trismegistus was the primary source, from the point of view of the Renaissance, of this whole mystery tradition. And you recall from last night's lecture that this is based on a misunderstanding. The Renaissance believed that Hermes Trismegistus was older than Moses. We know now, thanks to Isaac and Maric Casabon, two philologists of the early 17th century, that definitely the Hermetic corpus was composed between the first and second centuries after Christ. The method of the Casabons was to examine the philosophical language of the corpus Hermeticum and show that there were words and phrases there that were post-Platonic and derivative from philosophers whose dates we have fully in hand. Now, if you go to an occult bookstore, you will find that to this day this error persists. There are people who still want to claim that this stuff is older than dynastic Egypt. There are even books available. I was in Shambhala a week ago claiming to teach you how to change lead into gold. Well, from my point of view, this just evokes a small smile. The old errors persist. The puffers are still at it. But what Hermes Trismegistus is, is a character who appears in many guises in these Hermetic dialogues. The Hermetic hymns are usually couched in the form of dialogues between Hermes and his son Thoth. And Thoth takes the role of the uninitiated ingenue who is sitting at the feet of the master. And Thoth asks questions. What is the true nature of the world? What is the true nature of man? And Hermes answers. And the general form of these texts, with exceptions because there are 20 of them, is an intellectual dialogue which builds to an ecstatic revelation, and then in the wake of the ecstatic revelation there is a hymn of praise to Hermes Trismegistus. Trismegistus means thrice blessed, and is sometimes called Hermes Triplex, to distinguish this Hermes from all the other Hermes of early, middle, and late Greek thinking. Hermes is of course the messenger god, the god of scribes. The reason this ibis-headed being holding a staff is embossed on the cover of each of these books is because this is how Hermes Trismegistus thought Hermes was imagined. He was associated with the scribe god of the Egyptian pantheon. The two distinguishing factors, at least that stand out for me, that I think you need to incorporate into your thinking about the Hermeticism, two very important concepts. The first is the divinity of human beings, an extraordinarily radical idea in the context of late Hellenistic thinking. We all operate under the spell of the concept of the fall of man, that man is an inferior being, errors were made in the Garden of Eden, and that we are far, far from the nature of divinity. All magic, and all magic in the West is derivative from this tradition, takes the position that man is a divine being. Men and women are divine beings. The Corpus Hermeticum actually refers to man as God's brother. And this is a double-edged perception. It gives tremendous dignity to the human enterprise, but it also raises the possibility of the error of pride and hubris. In the Renaissance, Marcello Ficino boiled this notion down to the aphorism, man is the measure of all things. And you may notice that this is the position really of science, that man is the measure of all things, that it is up to us, we can decide the course of the cosmos. All magic stems from this position. This is why the church was so concerned to stamp out magic, because it assigns man an importance that the church would rather reserve to deities. So that's the first great division between Christian thinking and Hermetic thinking, an entirely different conception of what human beings are. And when we get into the text, I'll read you some of these passages. Now the second distinguishing factor, and notice that this position on man empowers tremendous freedom, man is the measure of all things. The second distinguishing factor in Hermeticism is the belief that we can control fate, that we can escape from cosmic fate. The late Hellenistic mindset was, and what you get in the Gnostics is the belief that because of astrology, because of the stars, we are subject to control from these exterior forces. In most Gnostic thinking, the whole concern is to somehow evade what is called the hemarmony, cosmic fate. And in the Gnostic systems, the only way it can be done is by ascending through the shells of cosmic ordering forces, the archons, the planets, the planetary demons, so forth and so on, and then beyond the hemarmony, which is actually thought of as a place in space that you would burst through, you transcend fate. What the Hermetic thought is, is that these fates become personified as the decons, as the stellar demons, and then it is held that there is a magic, a magical system, which is possible where you can call these archangels to your side and work with them, and not be subject to the inevitable working of the cosmic machinery. And this burst like a revelation over the late Hellenistic world, because there was such philosophical and emotional and political exhaustion that this comes, this is a counterpoise to the message of the New Testament, which is a similar message, you know, that you can be saved in the body, that you can escape the inevitable dissolution and degradation laid upon us by time. So these are the two distinguishing factors, the divinity of man and the possibility of using magic to evade the machinery of fate. So I want to read some of the Corpus Hermeticum to you to give you the flavor of it, but before I do, I want to say something about the history of these texts. You're all familiar, more or less, I'm sure, with Apuleius's The Golden Ass, which is a novel of initiation that is late Roman. Apuleius also put together what is called the Asclepius, and the Asclepius is true Hermetic literature that was not lost. It was the only one that was available throughout the Dark and Middle Ages. All the rest was lying untranslated in Syrian monasteries, in Tel-Jemistus-Pletho in 1490, and he brought these manuscripts to Florence, to the court of the Domenicis, and then the translation project began. Now the only other Hermetic material that was accessible throughout the High Gothic period was a book of magic called Picatrix, and Picatrix was probably written in the 1200s, so this elicits screams of dissent from the burning-eyed faction, but reason dictates that we consider Picatrix 12th century, so only the Asclepius and the Picatrix represented this strain of thought before the 1460s, and the importance of Hermetic thinking can be seen by the fact that Jemistus-Pletho brought Plato to the Florentine council as well as Hermes Trismegistus, and when Marcello Ficino sat down to do this translation work, Cosimo Domenici said, Plato can wait, I'm getting old, you do the Hermetic corpus first, that's much more important, we'll sort out this Plato business in a few years, and so it was done, it was completed in 1493, and in 1494 Cosimo died, so he never saw the translations of Plato, but felt that the corpus Hermeticum was more important, just I mention this to show you the importance that was attached to this stuff. Here is one of the key passages on man's nature, this is from book one of the corpus Hermeticum, But mind the father of all, he who is life and light, gave birth to man, a being like to himself, and he took delight in man as being his own offspring, for man was very goodly to look on, bearing the likeness of his father. With good reason then did God take delight in man, for it was God's own form that God took delight in, and God delivered over to man all things that had been made, this is the basis of the Ficinian statement, man is the measure of all things, and man took station in the maker's sphere, and observed the things made by his brother, who was set over the region of fire, and having observed the maker's creation in the region of fire, he willed to make things for his own part also, and his father gave permission, having in himself all the working of the administrators, this is a reference to the angel hierarchy, and the administrators took delight in him, and each of them gave him a share of his own nature. So man is the brother of God, and the creature at home with the angels, this idea is echoed in the Asclepius, which you'll recall was available throughout the Middle Ages, the range of man is yet wider than that of the demons, meaning the angels, this term is transposable in Hermetic thought, the individuals of the human kind are diverse, and of many characters, they like the demons come from above, and entering into fellowship with other individuals, they make for themselves many and intimate connections with almost all other kinds, and then the famous passage, man is a marvel then, Asclepius, honor and reverence to such a being, man takes on him the attributes of a god, as though he were himself a god, and he is familiar with the demon kind, for he comes to know that he is sprung from the same source as they, and strong in the assurance of that in him which is divine, he scorns the merely human part of his own nature, how far more happily blended are the properties of man than those of other beings, he is linked to the gods inasmuch as there is in him a divinity akin to theirs, he scorns that part of his own being which makes him a thing of earth, and all else with which he finds himself connected by heaven's ordering, he binds to himself by the tie of his affection. So, this is an incredibly radical conception of what it means to be human, so radical that it is unwelcome even in the present context. Notice, the modern feeling of this stuff, I mean, this is not biblical rhetoric, this is philosophical discourse as we know it and carry it out ourselves. This is a passage on the adept and initiation. Now, this is, let me see who is speaking here, Fawkes speaks to Pymandris, this is book one. But tell me this too, said I, God said, let the man who has mind in him recognize himself, but have not all men mind? And then Pymandris replies, O man, said mind to me, speak not so, I, even mind, come to those men who are holy and good and pure and merciful, and my coming is a succor to them, and forthwith they recognize all things, and win the Father's grace by loving worship and give thanks to him, praising and hemming him with hearts uplifted to him in filial affection. Again, the reference to being God's brother, in filial affection. And before they give up the body to the death which is proper to it, they loathe the bodily senses, knowing what manner of work the senses do. Now, this introduces the theme of asceticism, that like, excuse me, like the Gnostics, there is a, in much of the Hermetic literature, a kind of horror of the earth, a desire to ascend and to get away from it. Scott makes the distinction between what he calls pessimistic Gnosis and optimistic Gnosis, and within the 20 texts of the Corpus Hermeticum, you get vacillation on this point. In some cases, the Mandaean, the Sibean tendency is there, and the world soul is invoked, and the whole of creation is seen as a living being involved in this soteriological process, this process of salvational mechanics through magic. In other texts, this Gnostic horror of matter is very strongly stressed. It's very clear that the Hellenistic mind was ambivalent on this point, even as we are ambivalent on this point. I mean, it's a real question. Are we here to be the caretakers of the earth, or are we strangers in the universe, and is our task to return to a forgotten and hidden home, no trace of which can be found in the saturnine world of matter? It's very hard to have it both ways. You're going to have to sort of take a position on that, and these people were forced into the same dilemma. There's no middle ground between those two positions, and so that dichotomy, that conundrum, haunted a lot of Hermetic thinking. Here is the Hermetic creation myth. This is Book 3, paragraphs 1 through a few, and you will see the comparison, the similarities to the Christian creation myth, but with extraordinary differences. There was darkness in the deep, and water without form, and there was a subtle breath, intelligent, which permeated the things in chaos with divine power. Then, when all was yet undistinguished and unwrought, there was shed forth holy light, and the elements came into being. All things were divided one from another, and the lighter things were parted off on high, the fire being suspended aloft so that it rose unto the air, and the heavier things sank down, and sand was deposited beneath the watery substance, and the dry land was separated out from the watery substance and became solid, and the fiery substance was articulated with the gods therein, and heaven appeared with its seven spheres, and the gods were visible in starry forms with all their constellations, and heaven revolved and began to run its circling course, riding upon the divine air, and each god, by his several power, set forth that which he was bidden to put forth, and there came forth four-footed beasts, and creeping things, and fishes, and winged birds, and grass, and every flowering herb, all having seed in them according to their diverse natures, for they generated within themselves the seed by which their races should be renewed." And then it goes on to describe the birth of man. Now, this kind of thinking is what alchemy seized upon in its ambitions. In a way, one way of thinking about what alchemy came to attempt is the thinking went like this. Since man is God's brother, the purpose of man is to intercede in time, and it was believed that ores, precious metals, and things like this grew in the earth. It was a thoroughgoing theory of evolution that reached right down into the organic realm, so it was thought that gold deposits in the earth would actually replenish themselves over time, and it's passages like this that give permission for that kind of thinking. In line with that, we're now in book four, and remember, the tone changes slightly from book to book. They were, after all, written over a 300-year period by various people. You must understand, then, that God is preexistent and ever-existent, and that he alone made all things, and created by his will the things that are. And when the Creator had made the ordered universe, he willed to set in order the earth also. He willed to set in order the earth also, and so he sent down man, a mortal creature made in the image of an immortal being, to be an embellishment of the divine body. For it is man's function, here it comes, the purpose of man, according to book four, for it is man's function to contemplate the works of God, and for this purpose he was made that he might view the universe with wondering awe, and come to know its maker. Man has this advantage over all other living beings, that he possesses mind and speech. Now speech, my son, God imparted to all men, but mind he did not impart to all. Not that he grudged it to any, for the grudging temper does not start from heaven above, but comes from being here below, in the souls of those men who are devoid of mind. This introduces the concept of an elect, or a perfecti, a hierarchy of human accomplishment and understanding, and this is also basic to Gnosticism. It's not for everyone, they're saying, it's for the pure of heart, and then what pure of heart means depends on the school you're looking at. For some it was mathematical accomplishment, for others it was contact with the logos, for others it was an ability to resist the temptations of the senses, but there was always this sense of the higher and lower possibility within the human experience. Everybody with me so far? This is at the opening of book 12, and this is a book with a heavy Mandaean sensitivity, this sensitivity to life. Now, this whole cosmos, and notice how this transcends even the Buddhist point of view, because in Buddhism plants have no soul. This is a tremendous failure in the Buddhist conception, as far as I'm concerned. Okay, this is Book 12. Now, this whole cosmos, which is a great God and an image of Him who is greater and is united with Him and maintains its order in accordance with that will, is one mass of life, and there is not anything in the cosmos, nor has been through all time, from the first foundation of the universe, neither in the whole nor among the several things contained in it, that is not alive. There is not, and has never been, and never will be in the cosmos anything that is dead. For it was the Father's will that the cosmos, as long as it exists, should be a living being, and therefore it must needs be a God also. How then, my son, could there be dead things in that which is a God, in that which is an image of the Father, in that which is one mass of life? Deafness is corruption, and corruption is destruction. How then can any part of that which is incorruptible be corrupted, or any part of that which is a God be destroyed? And there are other passages, this is a good one, this is Book 18. For as the Son, who nurtures all vegetation, also gathers the first fruits of the produce with his rays, as it were, with mighty hands, plucking the sweetest odours of the plants, even so we too, having received into our souls, which are plants of heavenly origin, the efflux of God's wisdom, must in return use his service for all that springs up in us. Now this conception that the human soul is a plant is a unique idea. I don't know of another tradition. Those of you who were with us in Ojai, we heard Johannes Wilber talk about how among the Amazon Indians, the Warao, the men actually marry trees. They actually take trees as their wives. A tree, and it is a man's job throughout his life to take care of his tree with the same tenderness and attention that he lavishes on a living wife. This is a more radical conception than that. This is the conception that the most important part of us is a plant. It reminds me of the joke that I occasionally make in these groups, the notion that animals are something invented by plants to carry them from place to place. Well, according to this, that's right on. So the sensitivity to the vegetative nature of the world is so great that it raises the plant to be the pith essence, the soul of man, the brother of God. So you see the valuation of the vegetative universe here is of an extremely radical type. Yes, Camilla? Tommy, I was just going to ask you if you had that upper-dimensional perception of humanity that was being mined with that predetermined effort for someone to go higher. No, it is not predetermined. It is something that is acquired through cultivation of a relationship to, in the Hermetic language, nous, the higher mind, and in the Gnostic language, logos, the informing spirit. But yes, no, the whole thrust, yes, and nothing is predetermined in the Hermetic system because through magic we can overcome the energies of cosmic fate. This is the great good news of Hermeticism, that we are not subject to fate. We should probably talk a little about this logos concept. This is something which seems very alien to modern people unless they are psychedelically sophisticated. The logos was the sine qua non of Hellenistic religion, and what it was was an informing voice that spoke in your head or your heart, wherever you want to put it, and it told you the right way to live. You get this idea even in the later Old Testament where it said that the truth of the heart can be known, that it is no great dilemma to know good from evil. You simply inquire of your heart, is it good or evil, and you will discover a voice which will tell you. All the great thinkers of this Greco-Hellenistic period thought and cultivated the logos. Plato had his demon. Everyone thought the informing voice of the noose, that's what it's called in Neoplatonism, and in Hermeticism and then in Gnosticism, the logos. Now, for modern people, well no, for me, the only way I've ever had this experience is in the presence of psychedelic substances, and then it is just crystal clear, there is no ambiguity about it. Somehow it's possible for an informing voice to come into cognition that knows more than you do. It is a connection with the collective unconscious, I suppose, that is convivial, conversational, and just talks to you about the nature of being in the world and the nature of your being in the world. It's puzzling to us because it seems so remote. I mean, for us, the voice in the head or the heart is pathology, and you may know the famous story of, in the first century, some fishermen were off the shore of the island of Argos in the Mediterranean Sea, and they heard a great voice from the sky, and the voice said, Great Pan is dead, Great Pan is dead. Well, people like Lactantius and Eusebius, these patristic fathers, the people who built Christianity, who took the Gospels and turned it into a world religion, they took this annunciation from the sky of the death of Pan as the annunciation of the change of the aeon. In other words, by the aeon, I mean these 2,000 year, roughly 2,000 year periods that are associated with the equinoctial procession. Do you all understand how this works? That over 26,000 years, the heliacal rising of the solsticeal sun slips slowly, slowly from one house to another, and around AD 100, I mean there's argument because these things are never precise, but around AD 100, the age of Pisces began, and the previous aeon ceased, and the cosmic machinery, the great gears of the largest scale of the cosmic machinery clicked past a certain point and into the age of Pisces, and this was then taken as very fortuitous for Christianity because Christ was associated with the sign of the fish and was seen as a Piscean movement. But I believe that it's entirely possible that the logos at that moment, that rough moment in time, fell silent, and that it has been silent for 2,000 years, and what we have had then is the exegesis of text and noetic archaeology of the sort we're carrying on here, but that now a phenomenon as trivial and high-paunted as channeling can be seen as the reawakening of the logos. The long night of Piscean silence is ending, and the spirit of noose is again moving in the world, speaking in the minds of the adepts and the hierophants who have the techniques and the will to connect with this stuff. I don't know how I got off on that, but obviously this kind of literature can be seen as the last message from the fading logos. The last statements before the change of the aeon have rendered this control language very difficult and non-intuitive and somewhat incomprehensible. General, that's the first of the reading where you broke off. I was puzzled about the use of the word mind. What's the context? It's Scott's translation of this word noose. It simply means this universal permeating intelligence. And the statement there is that it is only available to and it leads through asceticism and desire, intent. And then there are prescriptions. We haven't gotten into this, but they lived a life of purity, although their definitions of purity varied widely. As far as I'll say, the flip-flop that land is the brother of God and still we have to earn it, it makes it not to us. That's right. We have to desire that. That's right. No, this persists right up until, well, to this moment. But for instance, the quote I always love is from Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan. Thomas Hobbes, you know, was the great theoretician of modern government and social organization and he was basically a paranoid S.O.B. And he says, in the Leviathan, he says, man to man is like unto an errant beast and man to man is like unto a god. And it's absolutely true, you know, our noblest aspirations and our most hideously dehumanizing activities take place in the context of our relationship to other people. This is what the alchemists were trying to do, you see. They were trying to separate the gold from the dross. They were trying to take the errant beast and when we look at alchemical art, we will see dragons, dogs, pigs. We will see the errant beast and we will see the angelic beings that are trying to be separated out of our nature. This is within each and every one of us. Man to man is like unto a god and man to man is like unto an errant beast. I have a question. According to my understanding of the Platonic tradition and Neoplatonic thought, it has to do with the divine divine and Plato. Well, you raise an important point. It further complicates the picture, but it's how it was, folks. And that is, the reference here is to Neoplatonism, which is a kind of parallel tradition to what we're talking about. Plato had at least a couple of phases in the evolution of his thinking. The young Plato is a rational thinker. But the later Plato, apparently after he fell under the influence of Pythagorean schools, becomes a full-blown mystic. And then in the late Roman Empire, now this is almost a thousand years after Plato. We have to remember, in our minds, all these people get squeezed together like they could all have dinner together. But, you know, Plotinus is as far from Plato as we are from King Canute. So you have to bear in mind the scale of history. But so 900 to 1,000 years after Plato, a Byzantine school of philosophy arose around Porphyry, Plotinus, and Proclus as the major exponents. And they worked with the late Plato and elaborated a beautiful mystical cosmology. This is what I did a workshop here on a year ago. And many of those ideas and terms parallel conceptually the stuff in the Corpus Hermeticum. And if you're of a certain intellectual bent, you may find yourself more comfortable with the Neoplatonists than with this. This material tends to be emotional, evocative, poetic. And while there's great poetry in Plotinus, there's also very tight thinking that goes along with it. And there are other traditions. I mean, I'm making it simple for you. There was a whole tradition of what was called the Chaldean Oracles. And this was a collection of 100 or more fragments, all of which were the great commentary of Eusebius in 30 volumes. Iamblichus, one of them. That's all lost. We don't have that material. And it is, in a way, the most mysterious of these traditions because it just didn't survive. And it may be that that, the Chaldean Oracles, is the missing link to push this stuff back several centuries deeper into time. Because the Chaldean Oracles may actually be pre-Platonic. There's considerable evidence of that. But these are very arcane matters. I mean, you have to give yourself over to a lifetime of learning these languages and the philology of these languages to penetrate this stuff. The Hermetic corpus was largely Alexandrian. There were also Christian Platonists in Alexandria. There were certain centers. Rome, Byzantium, Alexandria, Heliopolis in Egypt was a cult site that was maintained for a very long time. If you're interested in this stuff but you don't like to absorb it this way, Flaubert, of all people, the Flaubert of Madame Bovary wrote an incredible novel called The Temptation of St. Anthony in which he describes second century Alexandria in a fictionalized form and gives you a real flavor for the intellectual complexity of the Alexandrian world. You see, Christianity had not yet gelled. It was many things. So you not only have Gnostics of five or six schools, Simonists, Valentinians, Basilidians, and so forth, but you also have Christians, a number of cults calling themselves Christians, that were also in furious competition. Dositists, Montanists, and later Nestorians. There were gymnasophists from India, people who were actually carrying yogic doctrines into the Mediterranean world. Plus you then have all the surviving cults of the older Egyptian strata, the cults of Isis and Seville and Adonis and Dionysus, and it just goes on and on. I mean, the richness of this intellectual world is very, there's nothing comparable in our experience. And it shows the passion with which people were trying to understand the dilemma of a dying world, because this is what they were confronted with. The intellectuals of the empire could feel it all slipping through their hands. And Flaubert gives a wonderful picture of this. I mean, Flaubert has a very romantic streak, and he likes flunking hashish to read this book. I mean, the attention to fabric and architecture and food and odor, and then because the subject matter is the temptation of St. Anthony, it's an excuse to describe these temptations in all their sensual richness and erotic kinkiness. It's a wonderful way to absorb this material. But, you know, something else made the point about the meek or the poor. If one considers society as you had in Alexandria or some of the last centuries, the only people who really had access to this were people who, first of all, had money. Correct. And who were intelligent. Could read. Yes. You had to be able to read. They already have an elite group. That's right. That's right. No, very definitely. What survives from a civilization is its literatures, and these literatures are usually the production of an elite. And we have to remember, you know, don't have any illusions about the Roman Empire. I mean, I always think of the wonderful description. I don't even know why it's there. But Boris Pasternak in Dr. Zhivago goes off on a rip about ancient Rome, and he describes it as a bargain basement on three floors. I mean, this was an empire that lived by human cruelty. It was on the backs of slaves that this airy intellectual speculation was based. I mean, it was a tremendously pluralistic society, but that pluralism was maintained by standing armies of enormous size and policies of occupation of enormous cruelty. I mean, because of our relationship to the Christian tradition, we're aware of such things as the zealot revolt of 69 and the reign of Herod Antiochus in Jerusalem and so forth and so on. But that was just one little corner of the empire. And in Armenia, in Gaul, in Spain, in North Africa, military governors were carrying out outrageous suppressions of native populations. I mean, it was not a pretty time to be alive. And what comes down to us then is the yearning to escape from that. No wonder these people saw the Earth as a cesspool and a trap, because that's what it was for them, without doubt. And our own age is very similar. I mean, we do not have slavery, but we suffer under propaganda, mass manipulation of ideas, and the degradation and exploitation of the Third World on a scale the Roman Empire couldn't even dream of. So there is a great affinity. If any of you are interested in this kind of thing, I highly recommend a book by Hans Jonas called The Phenomenon of Life. It's a book of philosophical essays, but there's one essay in there called Gnosticism and the Modern Temper, in which he shows that once you take Gnosticism and dump the angels and the star demons and all the colorful bric-a-brac of late Roman thinking, what you have is a thoroughgoing existentialism, completely compatible with Jean-Paul Sartre, Jean Genet, and the kind of intellectual despair that characterized the post-World War II generation in Europe. Heidegger is thoroughgoingly Gnostic in his intentionality. It's just that the language is modern and stripped of this magical thinking, and by being stripped of magical thinking, in a way the modern recension of that state of mind is even more hopeless and disempowering. Fortunately, I think we're moving out of the shadow of that, but I'm 44 years old. I grew up reading those people, and it made my adolescence much harder than it needed to be. I mean, my God, there wasn't an iota of hope anywhere to be found. And that's why, for me, psychedelics broke over that intellectual world like a tidal wave of revelation. I mean, I quoted to you last night Jean-Paul Sartre's statement that nature is mute. Now I see this as an obscenity almost, an intellectual crime against reason and intuition. It's the absolute antithesis of the Logos. And much of our world is ruled by men older than I am who are fully connected into that without any question, and they just think all the rest of this is namby-pamby, ecological soft-heartedness of some sort. There is no openness to the power of bios, to the fact of a living cosmos. This is what Rupert Chodrak is always trying to say. The reinvestiture of spirit into matter, the rebirth of the world soul, is a necessary concomitant to what we now understand about the real nature of the world. In a way, the theory of evolution, which was born in the 1850s, is the beginning of the turning of the tide, because even though the first hundred years of evolutionary theory was fantastically concerned to eliminate teleology, eliminate purpose, nevertheless, nobody ever understood that except the hardcore evolutionists. To everybody else, evolution meant ascent to higher form. And once, you know, I once heard someone say, if it doesn't have to do with genes, it ain't evolution. Well, that's a tremendously limited view of what evolution is. I mean, the inorganic world is evolving, the organic world is evolving, and there the currency is genes, but also the social and intellectual world of human beings is evolving, and there the currency is not genes but means. So that idea, it carries with it the implication of ascent to higher form, and correctly broadened and understood becomes permission for a return to optimism and to the kind of hope that these folks were trying to articulate. It seems to me that my idea is, if it is available through trial, then we're back in a separation. I find it so, sometimes I do, that this is, to me, a thought separation. Yes, you're right, but it's the separation necessary for philosophical discourse. That's why philosophical discourse is not the top of the mountain. Language itself is the process of making distinctions that are false. This is why all language is a lie. This is why the ultimate truth lies in something unspeakable. But the ascent to the unspeakable is through this kind of philosophical analysis. Let me see, that reminds me of something, but does somebody else have something they want to put? I think the language is going to be the vehicle. Well, it's the vehicle, but eventually there's no road, and you have to park the vehicle and get out and walk, I think. And that's the journey Plotinus, the great Neoplatonist, has this wonderful phrase. He calls the mystical experience the flight of the alone to the alone. And I love this image, it's so uncompromising, and it's about as true as something can be and still move in the realm of language. Because it's saying, you know, finally words fall away, and finally there is only that which cannot be said. Many of you who have stuck with me know that I love to quote this poem by this obscure poet who died in the trenches of France in the First World War, Troubled Sickness. And he wrote a poem called Meaning's Edge, and the punchline goes like this. Meaning's Edge. I look over Meaning's Edge and feel the dizziness of the things you have not said. And I think that every one of these weekends, this is the effort to carry you to the edge of an abyss, and then push you over into the dizziness of the things unsaid. And they'll always be unsaid. I mean, Wittgenstein, God bless him, had the concept of what he called the unspeakable. He said philosophy operates in the realm of the speakable. Eventually we must confront that which cannot be said. The dizziness of things unsaid. And that's where real authenticity then flows back into the world of community and speech. But it comes from a place of utter silence and unsayability. How could it be otherwise? I mean, what hubris it would be to expect that the small mouth noises of English could encompass being. I mean, that's a primary error that all philosophy chooses to make at the beginning of its enterprise in order to do this set of shots at all. No. These are lower dimensional slices of a reality that is ultimately unitary, ineffable, unspeakable, and dazzling. Anybody else? No? Shall we do more? Yeah, please. The discourse of verbal and mental masturbation. Absolutely. And masturbation, you see, because it is, there's a pun here, but it's autopoetic. It is completely out of yourself. There is no union with the other. And the other is what you're always trying to get to. The other is a common term in these literatures. The other is that which cannot be fully known. You know, I always like to quote the British entomologist J.B.S. Haldane, who made a wonderful statement. He said, the universe is not only stranger than we suppose, it is stranger than we can suppose. And that's a dizzying perception. It's one thing to think it's very strange. It's quite another thing to realize that it is stranger than you can suppose. You may suppose and suppose and suppose, and you will fall so far short of the mark that it's absurd. That's what it means to be in the presence of a mystery, you see. The modern word mystery translates out to unsolved problem. That's not what a mystery is. A mystery is not an unsolved problem. A mystery is a mystery. And ratiocination can exhaust itself and make no progress with it. And that's what's at the core of our being. And that was what was at the core of this ancient perception. I mean, these were thoroughly modern people. They were shoved up against the same things that tug at our hearts and our minds and our souls. And beyond that, there's not a whole hell of a lot that you can say about it. This is an idea that will not die. But its practitioners, as you say, they end up in footnotes. They do not have a happy fate. Certainly Henri Bergson, with his idea of the élan et l'état, this is an effort to preserve this idea of the world's soul. And yet the fate of Bergson, his influence on modern philosophy is certainly minimal. Alfred North Whitehead is my great favorite. I mean, I think Whitehead is just the cat pajamas. And he has this idea of the living cosmos, that life and vitality extend right down into the electron. And yet, in spite of his mathematical contributions, the fact that he wrote Principia Mathematica with Bertrand Russell, Whitehead is not taught. I mean, there's some, I guess, one university in this country where they take him seriously. The modern philosophy is a desert for my money. And who cares about it? Nobody cares about it. Who's living their life according to the conceptions of modern philosophy? Nobody, as far as I can see. But yes, vitalism was this impulse in biology that persisted clear up until the 1920s with embryologists like Dreesch and his school. And mechanical biology has been at great pains to suppress that. That's why Rupert Sheldrake is such a breath of fresh air. Because he can be seen as a person carrying the vitalist message back into science. And his new book on the greening of science and nature is nothing more than a manifestation, I'm sorry, a manifesto for the re-recognition of the presence of the world soul. What about the Native Americans? Was there any philosophy that was like that? Yes, well, aboriginal people, not only the Native Americans, but the tribes of the Amazon. If you live next to nature, this is such an overwhelming perception that it's never called into question. But you see, we trace, we, most of us, trace our civilization to desert dwellers who invented agriculture, who gave us surpluses, so then we had to build walled enclosures to defend our surpluses from starving neighbors. And we're talking 6,000 B.C. at Jericho for this kind of stuff. And so we have been cut off from the natural mind longer than any other group of people on earth. This is how we are able to carry out the demonic, in the negative sense, the demonic reconstruction of the world that we have. I mean, what we have done is, you know, if there is a sin, then we have sinned. You know, Robert Oppenheimer said, beyond all rational argument, the physicists have known sin. And it's because they reached into the heart of matter without reference. And their best trick was to call down the light that burns at the center of stars. And they call it down to the test centers of our deserts and on to the heads of our enemies, if necessary. But this is a cosmic sin. It's an abomination. It's the story of Western civilization. The first great error was the urbanization. Well, I don't know, first great error, the invention of agriculture was a pretty staggering bad turn. Then urbanization. And then a piece of bad luck that really we didn't need to have befall us, which was the invention of the phonetic alphabet. And with the invention of the phonetic alphabet, we moved away from symbolism and lost even the symbolic connection to the world. And that happened with the evolution of demotic Greek and even earlier languages, linear A and B and that kind of stuff. McLuhan talks a lot about this. I mean, we live in a universe so alienated that we can barely conceive of the way back. But hopefully, you know, archaeology is a wonderful thing. I mean, we are actually, as I said to you last night, digging into the stratigraphic layers of our past and reconstructing these ancient intellectual machines and setting their gears, turning and seeing how it works. And hopefully when we recover, we're like amnesiacs. We're like people who don't remember who we are or where we came from. We just wander mumbling through the streets of our cities, foraging in garbage cans and frightening other people. And yet if we could wake up, and archaeology and the rebirth of an awareness of the goddess and the pushing of science to the point where its irrational foundations become more clear. This is all part of a program of awakening of an archaic revival that will then make us part of the living world rather than a disease, a parasitic force on it. This refers to the theme I touched on a little bit last night of the importance of the imagination and how I think that our destiny lies in the imagination. God is ever existent and makes manifest all else. But he himself is hidden because he is ever existent. He manifests all things that is not manifested. He is not himself brought into being in images presented through our senses. But he presents all things to us in such images. It is only things which are brought into being that are presented through sense. Coming into being is nothing else than presentation through sense. This is so thoroughly modern, it's just staggering. I mean, for a thousand or fifteen hundred years people couldn't say anything that clearly. It is evident then that he who alone has not come into being cannot be presented through sense. And that being so, he is hidden from our sight. But he presents all things to us through our senses and thereby manifests himself through all things and in all things. And especially to those whom he wills to manifest himself. For though thought alone can see that which is hidden, inasmuch as thought itself is hidden from sight, and if even the thought which is within you is hidden from your sight, how can he, being in himself, be manifested to you through your bodily eyes? But if you have power to see with the eyes of the mind, then, my son, he will manifest himself to you. For the Lord manifests himself ungrudgingly through all the universe. And you can behold God's image with your eyes and lay hold on it with your hands. In my mind, this is the permission for the psychedelic experience, that we lay hold of the image of the Inescapable through the eyes. If you wish to see him, think on the sun, think on the course of the moon, think on the order of the stars. The sun is the greatest of the gods in heaven. To him, and to their king and overlord, all the gods of heaven yield place. And yet, this mighty god, greater than earth and sea, submits to have smaller stars circling above him. Who is it, then, my son, that he obeys with reverence and awe? Each of these stars, too, is confined by measured limits, and has an appointed space to range in. Why do not all the stars in heaven run like and equal courses? Who is it that has assigned to each its place, and marked out each for the extent of its course? And then it goes on and on. And then here is an amazing, modern anticipation of modernity. Would that it were not possible for you to grow wings and soar into the air, poised between earth and heaven, you might see the solid earth, the fluid sea, and the streaming rivers, the wandering air, the penetrating fire, the courses of the stars, and the swiftness of the movement with which heaven encompasses all. What happiness were that, my son, to see all these born along with one impulse, to behold him who is unmoved moving in all that moves, and him who is hidden made manifest through his works. This is an image of the planet seen from space. I mean, it's absolutely the unified image of our planet, and it is, I think, the central image in this early hermetic thing. This is the unifying, this is as close to an image of what Godhead is that they were able to reach. I mean, this is a shamanic flight that delivers a scientific description of the earth moving in space. This was written A.D. 150. This is Book 5. Nobody had that insight until we reached Giordano Bruno. And if you read Giordano Bruno in the hermetic tradition, you know that Bruno was burned at the stake. And the reason he was burned at the stake was because he looked up into the sky and did not see the stellar shells and the angelic hierarchies. Bruno had a mystical experience, and when it was over, he said, The universe is infinite. The stars go on forever. And that single statement was just the intellectual dynamite destroyed. The whole medieval, Hellenistic, the entire previous cosmological vision was left behind with that single statement. It was such a powerful statement that he had to go to the stake for that. And we've never recovered from that perception. It was a fundamental perception, and it occurred because he looked without precondition into the night sky and did not see, you know, wheels and demons and angels and shells of cosmic fate and necessity. He just said, you know, that's bullshit. What is there is infinite space, infinite time. The stars are hung like lamps unto the utmost regions of infinity. And this then inaugurates the beginning of modernity. And it's a perception that arose on the foundation of all of this earlier thinking. Here's another passage on the imagination. Yes. Well, in the practice, we know a lot less about that because there wasn't much secrecy around this. What we have are the philosophical discourses, and then when we talk about alchemy this afternoon, you'll see that there the technique becomes projection onto matter, that you enter into a kind of self-hypnosis, where by having these what we call naive ontological categories, in other words, not being sure exactly how much of mind is in matter or how much matter is in mind, you can erase the boundary between self and world and project the contents of the unconscious onto chemical processes. Now, what went on in the early phase here, we don't know. The hermetic, the trismegistic hems are largely, as you see them here, philosophical discourses. There was stress on diet and purity. Asceticism was typical of the hermetic approach. In Gnosticism, it went one of several ways. There were schools of Gnosticism which were vegetarian and puristic, and then because they felt that man was no part of the universe, that man was somehow hermetically sealed, if you will, hermetically sealed against contamination from the universe, some Gnostic schools said, you can do anything you want. You can have any kind of sexual arrangement you want. You can do anything you want because you are not, do not think that you are part of the universe. So you had Gnostic schools side by side, some orgiastic and quasi-tantric and some ascetic. There were Gnostic sects that, you see, because the idea was that light was trapped in matter by the act of procreation, there were Gnostic sects that only practiced forms of sexual union that couldn't lead to conception. So there were presumably exclusively homosexual sects. There were sects which only practiced anal intercourse. And for them, that was the same as celibacy because the real concern was not to trap any more of the light. And, you know, I don't seriously advocate this, but I think in our current situation of overpopulation, a little dose of this kind of thinking wouldn't be a bad thing. I mean, too much light is trapped in the organic matrix. And so they, and these Gnostic sects that, for instance, were exclusively homosexual or exclusively practiced anal intercourse, of course, they were suicide sects. They disappeared very quickly because they could only make converts by, in missionary conversion, you couldn't, you didn't have children, you couldn't hand it on. But it shows, you know, how thoroughgoing their rejection of the world was, how contaminated they felt themselves to be by the material world. But then you also had, as I mentioned, these optimistic schools that saw nature as something to be perfected and said man has been set onto the earth not to reject it, but to perfect it. And utopianism, the belief that one can create a perfect society, it goes back into these hermetic ideals because the idea was that a perfect society could be the goal of the alchemical work. Let me read you a passage from Giordano Bruno. This is a wonderful passage from the Picatrix. Remember Picatrix? This was the book of magical, 12th century magical texts that began to introduce these hermetic ideas. And this passage is the core passage that inspired the Rosicrucians and numerous other utopian movements. Here is Francis Yeats. Hermes Chismagistus is often mentioned as the source for some talismanic images and in other connections, but there is in particular one very striking passage in the fourth book of Picatrix in which Hermes is stated to have been the first to use magical images and is credited with having founded a marvelous city in Egypt. And here is the passage from the Picatrix. There are among the Chaldeans very perfect masters in this art and they affirm that Hermes was the first who constructed images by means of which he knew how to regulate the Nile against the motion of the moon. This man also built a temple to the sun and he knew how to hide himself from all so that no one could see him although he was within it. Now those of you who are scholars of Rosicrucianism know that one of the things that was always said about Rosicrucians was that they were invisible. This was how Robert Flood proved to people that he wasn't a Rosicrucian. He'd say, you're looking at me so how can I be one? And so he's in the temple but he could not be seen within it. It was he, Hermes Chismagistus II, who in the east of Egypt constructed a city twelve miles long within which he constructed a castle which had four gates in each of its four parts. On the eastern gate he placed the form of an eagle. On the western gate the form of a bull. On the southern gate the form of a lion. And on the northern gate he constructed the form of a dog. Into these images he introduced spirits which spoke with voices. Nor could anyone enter the gates of the city except by their permission. There he planted trees in the midst of which was a great tree which bore the fruit of all generation. On the summit of the castle he caused to be raised a tower thirty cubits high. On the top of which he ordered to be placed a lighthouse. The color of which changed every day until the seventh day after which it returned to the first color. And so the city was illuminated with these colors. Near the city there was abundance of waters in which dwelled many kinds of fish. Around the circumference of the city he placed engraved images and ordered them in such a manner that by their virtue the inhabitants were made virtuous and withdrawn from all wickedness and harm. The name of the city was Adocentine. Now, what we're familiar with from the photonic literature is a quasi-rational, largely rational approach to utopian thinking that you get in the Republic. However, students of the Republic will recall that the 5th or 10th book of the Republic contains the Myth of Ur, which we went over in detail in the section I did on Neoplatonism, and the Myth of Ur is one of the most bizarre and puzzling passages in the entire ancient literature. You recall Ur, E-R, was a soldier who died, he was killed in battle, but after 8 days he returned to life, and then he told a story that is the absolute puzzlement of ancient scholars. It's highly mathematical, it has to do with the spindle of necessity, and the description of some kind of cosmic machine, and all the ratios of the gears of this machine are given, and nobody knows what is being talked about. But here we have a different thrust, a magical utopianism, and the idea of a perfected human society using magic, because these engraved images that he ordered in such a manner that by their virtue the inhabitants were made virtuous, that means he was able to deflect the energies of cosmic fate. The city was immune to astrological malefic influence, it was protected, and when we talk later about the alchemical aspirations of the Rosicrucians and John Dee and Frederick the Elector Palatine of Bohemia, we'll see that this impulse toward an alchemical kingdom returns again and again. And again, in a way, utopianism is the forgated city of utopian magical dreaming is one version of the Philosopher's Stone. It's a kind of diffuse notion of the Philosopher's Stone, but it's a society in perfect harmony with fully realized beings living within it, practicing a cosmic religion that frees them from the... The impulses of cosmic fate. The other thing that is going on in some of this alchemical imagery is a kind of subtext of late alchemy is what's called the Ars Memoria, the art of memory. And, in fact, Francis Yates has a book called The Art of Memory, and this is a lost art, literally. It begins with the Roman orator Cicero, and was practiced up until the early 17th century. And what it consisted of was people, orators, it was considered very bad form to read your speech if you were an orator. And so you had to memorize your speech, and there were tricks of memory, and the commonest mnemonic trick was to think of a building. It was called the Memory Palace, a building that is familiar to you. I've done this myself with the University of California, because it's an area that I'm very familiar with, because I was a student there, and there are many buildings and many hallways and many floors. And what you do is when you make your speech, in your mind you are moving through the Memory Palace, and at various points you construct what are called emblemata. And the idea of these emblemata is that they be as unusual, shocking, and unexpected as possible in order to be memorable to you. So say you're giving a speech about the seven deadly sins. Well, so then Luxuria might be for you a nun copulating with a dog, and you'll set the nun and the dog in a little niche in the hallway of the Memory Palace. Well, then when you reach that place in your imaginary journey, all these associations will spring to mind, and you will be able to give your speech flawlessly. To us, this sounds tortured and peculiar, but it works quite well. One of the great practitioners of the Ars Memoriae was Giordano Bruno, and he wrote a book called Lo specchio delle bestia triunfante, The Expulsion of the Triumphant Beast. And, my God, Max Ernst, eat your heart out. I mean, this is a surreal epic read as straight plaintext, because that's not how it's supposed to be read. It's an agglomeration of these mnemonic emblemata that led him on then to probably give a fairly conventional disputation on one subject or another. But there are even old books of these emblemata that are, before surrealism, these were some of the wildest images that the Western mind would tolerate. The one thing that we didn't get into this morning was talking about the astrological side of it and the role of the Deccans. The Deccans are these demons, three to a sign, so there are 36 of them. And this was thought to be an astrological conceit that goes back to Egypt as opposed to the ordinary zodiacal significators which go back to Haran in what is now modern Iraq. And these Deccans were the demons that were summoned by these Renaissance magi in an effort to control and manipulate fate. You may, if you were paying attention this morning, notice that in all the reading I did from the Corpus Hermeticum, there was really nothing explicitly magical about it. It was philosophical. There was one mention, I think, of animating statues in the description of the four-gated city, but it was those magical animation passages that really captured the imagination of the Renaissance, and they built on that. And the idea, simply put, is that these Deccans and zodiacal signs are at the center of associative schemata, which include plants, minerals, odors, certain flowers, certain animals, everything had Deccanic assignation. And so, if you were involved in promoting an affair with a woman or something like that, then you would do an invocation to Venus, and you would gather the associated minerals, stones, animals, and you would put them in a room, and then certain musical, certain tonal modes were also associated with these things. And so you would play the music, you would have the flowers present, the minerals present, the invocations, and what you were trying to do is create a microcosm of the macrocosm to draw down this stellar energy. It wasn't about the classical Hollywood appearance of demons in a circle, that's the stuff of theatrics, the earlier, somewhat less refined style of magic. Let's see, yes, here it is, I did bring it. I wanted to read you one passage here from, this is Francis Yates again, in Giordano and the Hermetic Tradition, because this describes this change of status of a magician that we're interested in. And also what we didn't talk about this morning was the importance of Kabbalah, which came in quite late, but was then worked out in great detail. This was originally the idea, it was the Jewish contribution to this kind of magic, it was the idea that since the world had been made by Jehovah, by the speaking of words, in Principio et verbum et verbo caro facto mest, in other words, the speaking of Hebrew was thought to be the use of a primary linguistic tool for the purposes of creation. The problem for these Italians was very few of them spoke Hebrew, and so it was sometimes practiced silently, the mere constructing of these Hebrew letters and the setting out of messages in Hebrew was deemed efficacious as well. And then a further declension for people who were even frustrated with that was to channel magical languages which were pseudo-Hebraic in structure and appearance, and this is a whole branch of research much too arcane for us to go into here. The only non-Hebraic magical language that I may mention will be Enochian, and Enochian was an angelic language channeled to John E., and used by him in his magical evocations, and then later it was taken up by Aleister Crowley and the folks of the Golden Dawn. But there were many, many of these magical languages. The Vonage manuscript is written in one of them. But I want to read you this passage about how the Renaissance changed the status of the magician. We begin to perceive here an extraordinary change in the status of the magician. The necromancer concocting his filthy mixtures, the conjurer making his frightening invocations, were both outcasts from society, regarded as dangers to religion, and forced into plying their trades in secrecy. These old-fashioned characters are hardly recognizable in the philosophical and pious magi of the Renaissance. There is a change in status almost comparable to the change in status of the artist, from the mere mechanic of the Middle Ages to the learned and refined companion of princes of the Renaissance, and the magics themselves are changed almost out of recognition. Who could recognize the necromancer studying his picatrix in secret, in the elegant Ficino with his infinitely refined use of sympathies, his classical incantations, his elaborately neoplatonized talismans? Who could recognize the conjurer using the barbarous techniques of some clavis solomonis in the mystical pico, lost in the religious ecstasies of cabala, drawing archangels to his side? And yet, there is a kind of continuity, because the techniques are at bottom based on the same principles. Ficino's magic is an infinitely refined and reformed version of pneumatic necromancy. Pico's practical cabala is an intensely religious and mystical version of conjuring. So, now we move in this realm. I mean, these were the companions of princes, and there was, in that 120 years, from, let's say, 1500 to the beginning of the Thirty Years' War, a constant effort in various parts of Europe to try and turn European society toward a kind of magical revolution. I mean, the Europe of the 11th and 12th century was entirely ruled by scholastic rationalism. Witchcraft was virtually unknown and very curious. It's the 15th and 16th century where you get this tremendous proliferation of magical systems, magical ideas, and social hysterias related to witchcraft, alchemy, conjuring, and magic. I mean, those are the centuries when these things really broke out into the open. And alchemy in that period is basically a story of personalities, wonderful personalities, too many for us to really talk about in detail. I mean, we have Nicholas and Parthenel Slamel, who sought and found the Philosopher's Stone, according to legend, and according to legend are living to this day somewhere in Central Asia in perfect happiness, having achieved not only the Chemical Wedding, but the Water Stone of the Wives. And then we have Basil Einstein, who refined red wine and distilled it in distillation apparatus until he got essentially pure alcohol. And upon drinking this, he was so convinced that he had found the Philosopher's Stone that he announced the eminent approach of the end of the world based on his discovery. And he was not secretive at all. He propagated his recipes and, in fact, sampled the distillates of some of his brother alchemists and popularized this very widely. To this day, the reason certain cognacs are in the hands of monastic orders and no one else can make these things is because they were originally alchemical secrets. And many of these early alchemists were men of the cloth, quite a number of them. So, what I thought I would do is, in a highly chaotic fashion, read you some of this alchemical literature. Now, the big bring-down about alchemical literature is that apparently the muse didn't always smile on the alchemist, and some of this poetry is pretty tormented stuff. Why this is, who can say, but let's try one here and see if you can bear with it. Also, my Middle English is not as good as it might be. This is a short one, and typical, and you will see why the alchemists were charged with unbearable obscurity and Crolex prose. This poem is called A Description of a Stone. Though Daphne flies from Phoebus bright, yet shall they both be one. And if you understand this right, you have our hidden stone. For Daphne, she's fair and white, but volatile is she. Phoebus, a fixed god of might, and red as blood is he. Daphne is a water nymph, and hath of moisture store, which Phoebus doth confine and heat, and dries her very shore. They being dried into one, a crystal flood must drink, till they be brought to a white stone, which washed with virgin's milk, so long until they flow as wax, and no fume you can see. Then have you all you need to ask, praise God, and thankful be. This is a recipe for the production of The Philosopher's Stone. And the author, I'm sure, felt that he'd spoken as clearly as he'd dare speak, and yet, you know, making something like this is no easy task. This is from the Teatrium Chemicum Britannicum, and the late phase of alchemy. Here's another one. The world is a maze, and what you why? For sooth of late a great man did die, and as he lay a-dying in his bed, these words in secret to his son he said. My son, quote he, "'Tis good for thee I die, for thou shalt much the better be thereby, and when thou seest that life hath me bereft, take what thou findest, and where I have it left, thou dost not know, nor what my riches be. All which I will declare, give ear to me. An earth I had all venom to expel, and that I cast into a mighty well. A water-egg to cleanse what was amiss, I threw into the earth, and there it is. My silver all into the sea I cast, my gold into the air, and, at the last, into the fire, for fear it should be found, I threw a stone worth forty thousand pound, which stone was given me by a mighty king, who bade me wear it in a fourfold ring. Quote he, "'This stone is by that ring found out, if wisely thou canst turn this ring about, for every hope contrary is to other, yet all agree, and of the stone is mother. So now, my son, I will declare a wonder, that when I die this ring must break asunder. The king said so, but when he said withal, although the ring be broke in pieces small, an easy fire shall soon it close again. Who this can do, he need not work in vain, till this my hidden treasure be found out. When I am dead, my spirit shall walk about. Make him to bring your fire from the grave, and stay with him till you my riches have. These words a worldly man did chance to hear, who daily watched the spirit, but nay the near, and yet it meets with him and every one, yet tells him not where is the hidden stone." Now this stuff is obscure. It's deliberately obscure. It was obscure to its contemporaries. And the whole effort became one of collecting this kind of material and finding it out. And you have to understand, this was all circulating in manuscript. Very little of this was printed. The Theatrium Chemicum Britannicum was not printed until 1652. So this was a world without vehicular transportation other than the horse and carriage. And these people were paranoid of being discovered and persecuted for wizardry and witchcraft by the church. So each alchemist working in secret with a limited number of texts, with a local control language, created this vast conceptual patchwork of ideas. And this is in large measure responsible for the obscurity of what is said. Then another factor which impinges on this and further complicates the matter is that the name of the game was projection of the contents of the imagination onto physical processes. So taking red cinnabar, which I mentioned last night, and heating it in a furnace until it sweats mercury, for one alchemist this is the incineration of the red salamander and the collection of our Mercurius and the great pelican. They named their chemical apparati after animals and gods. And so the pelican is a standard distillation apparatus, basically a condenser on top of something which is boiled. And then these materials would be collected, ground, powdered, re-fired, mixed with other materials, re-fired again. And in the process these people were, we call it, I mean it's such a weak term, the projection of the intellect into this dimension, they were living in a waking dream. And many of the recipes are designed to wipe out the boundaries between waking and sleeping. Remember I talked about the river of mercury that runs between the yin and yang? Many of the alchemical processes were of 40 days duration. Well you can imagine a hermit fearing discovery by the church, trying to keep his fires not too hot, not too cold, working day after day, night after night. Eventually all boundaries dissolve and you're just living in a pure world of intellectual projection. And then in the swirling of the alembic, in the chemical processes going on in the retort, you begin to be able to project your conscious onto this. It's what we call visualization, but for us it's a very, it's kind of a weak term, because we don't, we are never really able to accept in the psychedelic state to transcend the belief in the inner world and the outer world being somehow separate. So for us it's always separate from us. But they were able to wipe out that boundary. Well then, what they saw in their swirling retorts and alembics was not carbonization, calcination, condensation of various molecular weights of liquids and oils out, but rather the birth of the red lion, the coming of the eagle, the appearance of the smaragdene stone. They had hundreds and hundreds of these words. And I didn't bring any with me, but much alchemical literature are dictionaries. Martinus Rulandus' Alchemical Dictionary is a huge book of words with special meanings in the alchemical context. And these, okay, so why? Why do this? And what happens when you do it? Well, no matter what alchemist you're reading, there's always an agreement that there are stages in the great work. Stages in the opus, as they called it. And you can't get any agreement on in what order these stages come, but roughly it's something like this. Most agree that it begins in the negredo, the blackening, our crow, the saturnine world of what we would call manic depression, despair. And that's our chaos, a chaotic, near-psychotic state of unbounded hopelessness. And that is the precondition then for the alchemical work, though the stages of the opus never occur in order. I had a dream last night that was, I think, triggered by an illustration in Fabricius that I'll show you tonight. But it was a classical alchemical dream. It was that I was at a country fair, and its antiquity was indicated by the fact that it was happening on the schoolyard of my childhood. And as I moved among the participants of this country fair, I began to notice that they were freaky. I mean, there were people with withered arms, and one side of their face slid down, and so forth and so on. The whole thing began to drift toward nightmare. And Richard Hermes Bird appeared in my dream as my alchemical compadre. And at one point, a black woman, perfect symbolism for the negrito, a black woman with three withered arms and six or seven breasts, slid herself sideways in front of me. And it was at that point that I went and found Richard and said, I think we better get out of here. Well, now, an alchemist would greet a dream like this with great anticipation and joy and would understand that this sets the stage now for the next movement forward. Well, then accounts differ, and those of you who really want to get into this, I recommend you read Mysterium Conjunctiones by Jung, The Mysterious Conjunction, and he discusses the negro, the negredo, in great detail. Another symbol for the negredo is the senex, the old man, because the old man is just short of death, and that's the state that the negredo makes you feel. Well, then you must take this raw, chaotic, unformed material, often compared to feces, compared to corruption, compared to the contents of an opened grave, and you must cook it in the alchemical fires of contemplation, prayer, and ascetic self-control. And then you will move through a series of stages that are associated with colors. There is the rubedo, the reddening. There is the sicinitas, the yellowing. There is the veriditas, the greening. And the order in which these occur differs according to who you follow. But then there is closure. At the end of the process, most alchemists, although certainly not all, agree that the higher state is the albedo, the whitening, the purificatio, right? So at each stage, there are sub-stages of dissolution, dissolution et coagulatio. And there's one alchemical aphorism that says, dissolution et coagulatio, know this, and this is all you need to know. And so it's a melting, and a recasting, and a purifying of psychic contents. Well, then a whole, so finally you reach the albedo, the whitening, the highest stage, the stage of great purity. But remember how I said last night that Mercury was always the metaphor for mind in alchemy, or one of the metaphors for mind in alchemy? I talked about its mutability, and its ability to take the shape of its container, and when you shatter it, it then splits into many reflections. So once you move into the domain of the albedo, the whitening, then a whole new problem arises for the alchemist. And this is the problem of the fixing of the stone. Somehow the mutability of Mercury must be overcome, and it must be crystallized. It must be fixed so that it doesn't get away from you, so that it doesn't slip through your fingers. To achieve our Mercury is nothing unless you have the secret of the coagulatio. And so then there's a huge amount of effort devoted to this. Well, what is being described is what Jungians call the individuation process, a dissolving of the boundaries of the ego, an allowing of the chaotic material of the unconscious to pour forth where it can be inspected by consciousness. And we'll see tonight when we look at this art that these images are full of ravening beasts, incestuous mother-son pairs, incestuous brother-sister pairs, hermaphrodites. All taboos are broken. This stuff just boils up from the unconscious, then it's sublimed through these processes, and then is somehow fixed. And this fixing, then, is the culmination of alchemy. And if you can bring off this trick, then you possess our stone, the philosopher's stone, the lapis, the sophic hydrolith of the wise, Arrhenius Philolaithes calls it. And there were hundreds of control words for naming the secret difficult to obtain, alchemical gold, in short. This is what we're after. And if you possess it, nothing else is worth anything, because it is psychic completion, peace of mind. Jung called it the self. It's the self that we are trying to recover. And remember we talked about the gnostic myths of the light trapped in matter. Well, this is the luminae de luminae. This is the light of light, the lux natura, the light drawn out of nature and condensed into a fixed form, which then becomes the universal panacea. And I'm using as many of these alchemical terms as I can draw out of my memory to give you a feeling for it. This is the universal medicine. It cures all ills. You know, it brings you riches, fame, wealth, self-respect. It's the answer. It's what everyone is looking for, and no one can find, you see. So this just became a consuming passion of the 15th and 16th century mind. And they thought they were on the brink of it. And along the way, they were discovering stuff like distilled alcohol, phosphorus, gunpowder, all of these things were coming out of the opchemical laboratories. But that was not it. You see, they kept driving themselves onward because they knew that this was not the real thing. And they were pursuing the real thing. Well then, for some people, it became then reassociated with this notion of the utopia that I mentioned this morning in the passage that I read about the city of Hermes Trismegistus. And they began to see it's almost like the crisis which overcame Buddhism. It must be an archetypal—and notice how rarely we've used that word here— it must be almost an archetypal stage in human thought. You know, Theravadin Buddhism stressed individual redemption through meditation on emptiness. And then, with the great reforms of Nagarjuna, the idea of bodhisattvic compassion was introduced. And that carries with it a political freight, an obligation to society and mankind. And so, as the 15th and 16th centuries progressed, there began to be this awareness that what was wanted was not for an alchemist to break through to his own personal salvation, but somehow to create an alchemical world. And you get then the notion of the multiplicatio, the idea that the stone, once created, will replicate itself and be able to change base matter into itself, almost like a virus spreading through the ontological structure of matter itself, and the world will be reborn. And this idea then—what was happening was these alchemists were getting bolder, and printing was invented in Mainz near Frankfurt in 1540. The distribution of these alchemical books was changing the character of alchemy. It was no more the solitary hermit working away in his cave or mountaintop far away from the minions of the church. Alchemists began to dream of banding together, of forming societies, of creating brotherhoods that were united in the sharing of their knowledge and their purpose. And this brings us to the curious episode in history called the Rosicrucian Enlightenment. And Dane Francis Yates once again got there first, and she wrote a book called The Rosicrucian Enlightenment, which traces the history of these alchemical brotherhoods and reveals to us what they were really about. And what they were about was this dream of somehow taking the philosopher's stone and the power, the immortality, the insight that it would bring, and making it a general utility of mankind. And in, you know, one way of looking at modernity, I mean, I have a friend who claims that the summoning of the Holy Spirit into matter can be seen as the creation of the modern world of electrical energy, that people like Helmholtz and Faraday were completing the alchemical work. It's very hard for us to realize how mysterious the electromagnetic field seemed to the 19th century. The 19th century had entirely imbued itself with the spirit of democratian atomism translated through Newtonian physics, and they believed, you know, that everything was little balls of hard matter winging through space. Well, when Helmholtz and Faraday and these people began to talk about action at a distance and generating the electromagnetic field and trapping lightning in lightning jars and running it through wires, what could this be but pneuma? What could this be but the trapping of spiritus? What could it be but the literal descent of the Holy Ghost into history? And, you know, give it a moment's thought. For thousands of years, electricity was something that you saw when you took an amber rod and a piece of cat fur and went into a darkened room and stroked the cat fur, and then when you would bring the amber rod close to the cat fur, you would see the crackle of static electricity through the cat fur. For thousands of years, that's what electricity was. Who would dream that you could light cities, that you could smelt metals, that you could illuminate the earth with this energy? And yet, you know, from the 1850s to the present, this was done. It's almost a literalizing, the final literalizing of the alchemical dream. But to go back now, I digress, I fear. Let's go back to the climate of the 1580s, and the central culprit here, and to my mind a giant figure casting an enormous shadow over the landscape of alchemy and modern science, is the Englishman John Dee. John Dee united in himself the complete spirit of the medieval magus and the complete spirit of the modern scientist. He invented the navigational instruments that allowed the conquest of the round earth. When Francis Drake sailed up the coast of California, he had navigational instruments that were top secret. The French, the Spanish must be kept away from this stuff, and these were navigational instruments created by John Dee that allowed him to locate himself anywhere on the globe. But John Dee was a man who, on a late summer evening in Mortlake, in his house in Mortlake outside London, the angel Gabriel descended into his garden and gave him what he called the show stone, S-H-E-W in old English, the show stone. And the show stone exists to this day. You can see it in the British Museum. And what's amazing about it is it's a piece of polished obsidian. It's an Aztec mirror, is what it is. And there was a ruler of the Aztecs named Smokey Mirror. How John Dee got this thing, we cannot even imagine. I mean, he says he got it from an angel. Nobody can really, nay, say that. However, I suspect that Cortez, on his first return to Spain from the New World, he brought a number of objects with him that he had collected in central Mexico. And somehow John Dee got his hands on this thing. And it was for him a television screen into the locus, and he used it over a number of years to direct the foreign policy of England. He was the confidant of Queen Elizabeth I. And he also was the most accomplished astrologer in Europe. And he used his ability to cast horoscopes as an entree into all the great houses of Europe, the kings and nobles of Europe. Well, he was functioning as an intelligence agent. He was a spy for the British crown, insinuating himself into these various courtly scenes and then writing back to Elizabeth in ciphers, ciphers that had previously only been used for magical purposes. He was sending back data on the strength of military garrisons and the placement of fortifications and this sort of thing. But this was what he was doing in the 1580s. He kept the showstone for a number of years, and he didn't seem to be able to make much progress with it. He had other methods, too. He had wax tables and sigils. But finally into his life came a very mysterious character named Edward Kelly. And some accounts say that Edward Kelly had no ears, which indicates that he had had his ears removed for being a charlatan and a montebank. This was a common punishment in the provinces of England. So Edward Kelly was a very dubious character, I think. For one strong piece of evidence that he was a shady character was John Dee was married to a much younger woman named Andy, who by all accounts was quite a beauty. And after gaining Dee's confidence as a scryer, the person who could look into the showstone and lay out these scenarios that the angels and the entities coming and going in the showstone were putting forth, Kelly revealed to Dee that the angels had instructed him to hit the hay with Anne. And this was a great crisis in their relationship. However, according to Dee's diary, and so it was done, we read. So, you know, hanky-panky didn't begin with the gold and gone, believe me. In 1582, Andy, John Dee, and Edward Kelly set out for Bohemia, and Rudolph, the mad king of Bohemia, held sway at that time. Now, this is another one of these bizarre figures in the whole story of this. Rudolph collected dwarfs. He collected giants. He had what was called a wunderkammer, a wonder cabinet. You see, before Linnaeus, before modern scientific classification, these great patrons of the arts and natural sciences, they would just collect weird stuff. And that was all you could say about him. It was rhinoceros horns, fossil ammonites, broken pieces of statues from antiquity, giant insects from southern India, seashells. All this stuff would just be thrown together in these wunderkammer, these wonder cabinets. And Rudolph was a great patron of the arts. Well, Kelly sent the word that he and Dee had perfected the alchemical process, and Rudolph immediately paid their way to Prague and patronized them very lavishly over a number of months. But then they didn't seem to be coming through, and he rented, he ordered a castle put at their disposal in Bohemia, and they still weren't able to come through. The Vonage manuscript figures in here, too, because Kelly's entree to Dee was that he had a manuscript in an unknown language, and I believe that this probably was the Vonage manuscript. The Vonage manuscript turns up in the estate of Rudolph, and the very month that he paid 14,000 gold ducats for it to persons unknown, Dee, who was always writing back to the Elizabethan court hounding them to send money, entered in his account book that they received 14,000 gold ducats from an unknown source. Dee was able to talk himself out of this alchemical imprisonment, but not before he had written a book called The Hieroglyphic Monad. Now, you have to understand the importance of this. As late as the 1920s, in England, in the better schools of England, like Eton, when you study geometry, you studied Euclid's works, and Euclid's geometry was always preceded by Dee's preface to Euclid. Until the 1920s, every English schoolchild studied this. He was a master mathematician, as well as all these other things. This was how he was able to produce these navigation instruments. So Dee, while imprisoned in Bohemia, wrote a book called The Hieroglyphic Monad, in which he proposed to prove, through a series of occult theorems, that a certain diagram, which unfortunately I didn't bring, The Hieroglyphic Monad, but it's basically the symbol of, you know, the symbol of Mercury, which looks like the symbol for female, but you put horns on it, and then there were some adumbrations to that. By a series of theorems, he built up this Hieroglyphic Monad, and he initiated a couple of young men, named Johann Andrei and Michael Meyer, into the mysteries of the Hieroglyphic Monad. Well, then he was able to get out of Bohemia, and he went back to England. Kelly, who had made much more extravagant claims, Rudolph kept at work on the alchemical opus, and Kelly became more and more desperate to escape, and one night, in 1587, he crept out on the parapet of this Bohemian castle, and a roof tile slipped beneath his feet, and he fell to his death, and became, so far as I can tell, alchemy's only true martyrs. Well, he returned to England, and he was now very old, and he died at Mortlake in 1606. Elizabeth died in 1604. Shakespeare was happening, Sir Philip Sidney was happening through this period, John Dee reputedly had over 6,000 books in his library, he had more books than any man in England. He had books, we have a partial catalogue of his library, he had books that do not exist now. He had Roger Bacon manuscripts, because you see, when Henry VIII kicked the Catholic Church out of England, the Northumbrian monasteries were looted by the Earl of Northumberland, and basically, Dee was allowed to pick over the loot from these monasteries, and there were Roger Bacon manuscripts which perished when Dee's library was burned by an angry mob while he was on the continent, because he was suspected of being a wizard. He was the model for Faust in the later recensions of Faust, and whenever you see an old man with a white beard and a pointed cap, this image is really referent to Dee. Well, Elizabeth died in 1604, I believe, and James I became King of England, and James was a peculiar character. The wags of the time liked to say, Elizabeth was King, and now James is Queen, and not only that, he hated cultism, he had no patience with the whole magical court that Elizabeth had assembled around herself. Well, now, meanwhile, in 1606, a very mysterious document began to circulate in Europe and in England called the Fama. This is the first word of a string of Latin words, the Fama, and two years later, the Confessio, and what these were were announcements that an alchemical brotherhood was seeking recruits. It was, these are the primary documents of Rosicrucianism. Now, Rosicrucianism was based on a fiction, and a fictional person, Christian Rosenkrantz, who was imagined to have lived almost 200 years earlier, in the 1540s, and been a great alchemist, and it was claimed that his tomb had been recently opened, and that there were books inside it, which set the stage for the alchemical revolution of the world. Notice how this occult mind always tries to reach back in time to give itself validity, and Christian Rosenkrantz was claimed to be the author of a series of books, the chief of which is called The Chemical Wedding. What this was all about, I believe, and the Rosicrucian Enlightenment makes it fairly clear, was D, during the period when he had been in Bohemia, had set out to lay the groundwork for an alchemical revolution in Central Europe, and he had made Johann André and Michael Maier his agents in this plot, and it was a plot, a plot to meddle with European history and to turn the Protestant Reformation toward an alchemical completion. They felt that Luther and Haas and these people had only gone so far, and that the culmination of throwing off the yoke of the Church would be the establishment of an alchemical kingdom in Central Europe. The target, then, of the attention of Michael Maier and Johann André and a number of these alchemists became the young Frederick, he's called Frederick the Elector Palatine. He was a prince of the Northern League in Germany. He ruled in Heidelberg, and Heidelberg, as you know, is a thousand-year-old university city, and I believe I mentioned that the alchemical press of Theodor Debray was operating out of Heidelberg. Heidelberg became a magnet for all the occult thinking going on in Europe, and all the puffers and alchemists, the gold makers, the philosophers, the charlatans, they all converged on Heidelberg, and André and Maier were advisors of the young Frederick, and they steered him by a series of political manipulations, too complex to tell, toward a marriage with the daughter of James I of England, who was named Elizabeth, interestingly enough. So, Frederick the Elector made Elizabeth the son of James of England his wife. Now, Frederick here made a serious miscalculation, because he thought that if James would give the hand of his daughter in marriage, that this was his way of blessing this alchemical conspiracy. Actually, what was on James's mind was he was about to give one of his sons in marriage to a Spanish princess of the Habsburg line, a Catholic. In other words, he was playing both sides against each other. He was not giving the green light to an alchemical revolution at all. It was assumed so. Well, then in 1617, 18, Rudolf, remember Rudolf, the emperor? He finally dies at a very ripe old age. And at that time, the Protestant League, which was made up of these princes of these small principalities scattered across Germany and Poland, they actually elected the emperor. It was not by right of primogeniture, but by election by what was called the Northern League, this group of princes. Frederick and his alchemical cohorts had done their political groundwork very, very skillfully, and they were able to engineer the election of Frederick to emperor of the empire. And he became Frederick the Elector Palatine of Bohemia. And this set the stage for an episode called the episode of the Winter King and Queen, one of the great, after Nicholas and Ferdinand Flamel, this is one of the great romantic stories of alchemy. They moved their court from Heidelberg to Prague, and all the alchemists went with them, and they assumed that English armies would support them if there was any squawk from the Habsburgs. And the winter of 1618, they ruled there and began to lay the groundwork for the transformation of Northern Europe into an alchemical kingdom. The problem was, as I said, the faithlessness and duplicity of James I of England. He did not support them, in spite of the fact that the fate of his daughter hung in balance. By May of 1619, the local bishop of the Catholic Church was fully aroused, and word had been sent to Madrid, and the Habsburgs raised an army and lay siege to Prague. And in the late summer, in the midsummer of 1619, the Winter King and Queen were driven from Prague, and the city fell to Catholic forces. The alchemical presses were smashed, and Michael Meyer, who was like the prime minister of this scene, was murdered in an alley of Prague, and the entire alchemical dream went down the drain. Frederick was killed in the siege of the city, and Elizabeth escaped to The Hague, where she lived in exile for many years. Well, until recently, I thought that that was the end of the story, but there is a codex that's very, or a coda, that is amusing, if nothing else. In that Habsburgian army, there was a young soldier of fortune, only 19 years old, still wet behind the ears, knowing nothing, happily soldiering and winching his way around Europe while he decided what to do with himself, and his name was René Descartes, the Frenchman. And Descartes, in his later years, reminisced about his period as a soldier in this army, and I like to think that it was actually Descartes who murdered Meyer. One of my ambitions is to write a play or a novel where these two confront themselves in a back alley of burning Prague and carry on a debate about the future of Europe before Michael Meyer falls to the sword of Descartes. Well, that may be apocryphal, but what is not apocryphal is that this Habsburgian army, having laid siege and destroyed the alchemical kingdom, began to retreat across Europe that fall, and by mid-September was camped near the town of Ulm in southern Germany. Now by a strange coincidence, Ulm is the birthplace of Einstein some hundreds of years later. But on the night of September 16th, Descartes had a dream, and in this dream, an angel appeared to him. This is documented by his own hand. And the angel said to Descartes, the conquest of nature is to be achieved through measure and number. And that was the beginning of the revelation that laid the basis for modern science. René Descartes is the founder of the distinction between the res virens and the res extensa, the founder of modern science, the founder of the scientific method that created the philosophical engines that created the modern world. How many scientists working at their workbenches understand that an angel chartered modern science, it's the alchemical angel which will not die. It returns again and again to guide the destinies of nations and peoples toward an unimaginable conclusion. I mean, that's not the last time that this angelic intervention in the history of science has occurred. Some of you may know the story in the 19th century of Kekulé, the German chemist who was struggling with the molecular structure of benzene, couldn't get it straight, and then had a dream in which he saw the Ouroboric snake take its tail in its mouth, and he awoke from that dream with the carbon ring burning in his mind. So, the carbon ring, the six-sided, heptagonal form of the carbon ring, is the basis for all organic chemistry. So, you know, and then I mentioned earlier Faraday and Helmholtz and the rise of the electromagnetic field. The point I'm trying to make is that however rational we may assume ourselves to be, however rational we may assume modern science to be, it is all really founded on angelic revelation, demonic intersection, and an extremely mysterious relationship between the human mind and the world of what science calls inert matter, which from this point of view is revealed to be not inert at all, but alive and pregnant with purpose for mankind. The alchemical kingdom of Frederick the Elector, then there were a series of adumbrations of this kind of thinking. I mean, many of you may know about the Freemasonry and the many Freemason revolts in Bohemia and Bavaria throughout the 16th and 17th century. Adam Weishaupt and the Illuminati is another effort to do this, and even the Royal Society founded by Newton and Hooke and those people was still an effort to redeem science for the spirit. So, the alchemical spirit lives on, it never really died, it's just that it has taken peculiar forms in our own day, and I mentioned I think last night that when you enter into nuclear chemistry, the most literal dreams of the profane side of alchemy, the transformation of lead into gold, has actually been achieved. I mean, it has no economic significance because the instrumentality to do it costs tens of millions of dollars, but nevertheless, yes, lead in our time has been changed into gold. So, that's basically all what I wanted to say about this stuff. I hope there are questions. Yes, Richard. Well, this is kind of a footnote on all of this. You remember I said that Kelly's entree to Dee was that he had a mysterious book, and you can tell from what I've said already, Dee was as big a sucker for books as I am. And so this book, Kelly's story was that he had gone to sleep in the ruins of a Northumbrian monastery and slept in an open sepulcher, a crypt of some sort. And when he awoke, he found beneath him two things, a vial of red powder, which he said was the transmissing powder, a necessary part to the alchemical opus, and a book in an unknown language, which he called the Gospel of St. Dunstable, possibly because this monastery had been dedicated to St. Dunstable. Well, now, Arthur Dee was John Dee's son, and he became an alchemist in his own right, and he said that when he was growing up, he recalled that his father spent many hours puzzling over a book, as he put it, all covered with hieroglyphics. But Dee, who elaborated the angelologic language called Enochian, never actually wrote or discussed the book that he had received from Kelly. It is definitely not written in Enochian. Enochian, when grammatically analyzed by computers, has a curious relationship to 16th century English. But when Dee and Kelly traveled to Europe, they were talking up Roger Bacon, who was a 14th century English monk who had dabbled in alchemy, and they claimed to have Bacon manuscripts, and Rudolph became very interested in this, and wanted to obtain some of these Baconian manuscripts. Now, I suspect that what happened was that Dee, by this time, had given up on deciphering the Gospel of St. Dunstable, and decided that he would palm it off on the emperor as a Bacon manuscript, because he didn't want to give up a real Bacon manuscript, because they were too valuable to him. So for 14,000 gold ducats, this thing changed hands, and Kelly and Dee and Anne were able to pay their bills, and Frederick had, I'm sorry, Rudolph had immense resources because of his position as emperor, and he brought his cryptographers and decipherers in to work on this Gospel of St. Dunstable, and got nowhere. Well then, when Rudolph died, a mysterious book was numbered among the artifacts of his estate, and I think we can assume it's this book. And one of the interesting things about this book is it has pages and pages of plant drawings, over 150 watercolors of plants, each carefully labeled, captioned in this unknown language. Well, if you know anything about decipherment, this is what a decipherer dreams of, because if you have a picture of the thing, and the caption, it doesn't take too much smarts to be able to figure out what's going on. Nevertheless, this was completely unhelpful. A third of the manuscript has pseudo-astrological material, in other words, what look like horoscopes and drawings of stars and stellar shells, but when carefully analyzed, dissolve into meaninglessness, cannot be associated with anything, and then a third of the manuscript shows little naked ladies in what can only be described as elaborate plumbing systems, and it was thought at one time that these must be drawings of the humors of the body in the liver, that these little naked women represented spirits moving inside the human body, or then somebody else's guess was it must show an obscure form of German hydrotherapy, because you know, the Germans were, if you've ever been to Baden-Baden or Marienbad, or these places where people take the waters, well, those places are old, old. And all this stuff is captioned, and there are even tables of contents, which again you would think would yield to decipherment. And so when Rudolf died, because of the botanical material in this book, it passed to the court botanist, a man named Marici, and he got nowhere with it. Well then, in the early 16th century, a great alchemist and polymath, some of whose art we'll see this evening, was Heinrich Kundrath. And Heinrich Kundrath was fascinated by artificial languages, and he heard about the Vonage manuscript. And we have a whole bunch of letters from Kundrath to the keepers of the estate of the emperor, trying to obtain this manuscript, which he finally did obtain. And then at that point, he makes no further mention of it in his diaries, the conclusion being that he too could get nowhere with this thing, but it just defied decipherment. Well, in 1619, at the outbreak of the Thirty Years' War, and that's what I forgot to mention in my earlier discussion, this episode of the Winter King and Queen is one way of debating the Thirty Years' War. It's usually considered to be the moment when a certain personage was hurled from a third-story window in Prague, and then fighting broke out in the streets. But really, the episode of the Winter King and Queen brought the thing to a head. Well, in 1619, to avoid being caught up in the Thirty Years' War, Kundrath decided to take holy orders and become a Jesuit. And so he gave his library, which was Compendious, to the monastery that he joined, which was a monastery in southern Italy. And there this thing sat until 1906, when a New York rare book dealer named Alfred Vonage bought the entire contents of this monastic library, and when he got it all back to New York and catalogued it, it was all very predictable 16th century theological and alchemical speculation, except here was this book in an unknown language. And Vonage kept it throughout his life, and then when he died, he gave it to Yale. And it is to this day at the Benecke Rare Book Room at Yale. Well, in the 1960s, the CIA became interested in it because the CIA is in the business of code making and breaking. I mean, this is a huge amount of energy goes into this, and if you know anything about the Enigma Project in World War II, you know that vast energies go into the production of unbreakable codes. And so they very systematically sought out all examples of encrypted material throughout history and just lickety split, deciphered it one after another. And all occult and magical codes known to exist in Europe can be traced back to one person, virtually to one person, to Trithemius, Bishop of Spondheim, who was the great teacher of Henry Cornelius Agrippa. All magical codes, if you know the Trithemian method within a few hours, you can get plain text. Well, the Vonage manuscript did not yield at all to this method. And the CIA formed a working group that for over 10 years would invite scholars in to have a look at this. And if you're interested in this, Marie d'Imperio, who was a great Renaissance scholar, wrote a book called The Vonage Manuscript, An Elegant Enigma, in which she traces the efforts of the CIA to figure this thing out, figure out what it could be. Well, there the matter rested until about three years ago when I think his name is Leo Levertov. Some kind of military historian, one of these peculiar people who live for this stuff, he got a hold of it and he said, and Imperial goes through all the decipherment, and there were many efforts at decipherment. There was a scholar at Yale in the 20s named Brumbaugh, who was a very respected man, who ruined himself by claiming a complete decipherment of the Vonage manuscript. And, you know, the way the game is played is you say what your rules for the decipherment were, you give them to a colleague, you give the rules to a colleague, and you give your colleague a page of text. If he can't translate it with your rules, then you are viewed as a deluded and misguided person and your career goes down in flames. Well, the Brumbaughian method for deciphering the Vonage manuscript had to do with confined pools of letters, where it would get you to a pool of five or six letters, but then you could freely choose which one you used. And critics of Brumbaugh demonstrated that you could make this thing say anything you wanted it to. Brumbaugh supported Dee's claim. He claimed that it deciphered out into a Roger Bacon manuscript that described a series of riots between the students and the Blackfriars at Christmastime in 1385 at Oxford. But nobody else could make it say that or make it say anything. So Brumbaugh disgraced him and ruined his career. And then there were other efforts at decipherment, which I won't bore you with, but along comes Leo Levertov just four years ago and he wrote a book called The Vonage Manuscript, a liturgical manual for the Catharites. And his great breakthrough, if you accept his translation, and I do, I know people who don't, but they don't seem to have read him as carefully as I have. I think the dude has it pretty well nailed to the barn door. His great breakthrough was to realize that it's not in code. It is not an encrypted manuscript at all. What it is is a synthetic alphabet, yes. It's an alphabet that no, and one of the things that baffled the CIA was they looted the libraries of Europe and they could never find another example of what is called a Vonage script. And this was just baffling. I mean, how could there be no other example of this script? Well, it appears that what happened was someone created a synthetic alphabet and then in a mixture of medieval polyglot Flemish with a huge number of loan words in Old French, Middle High German, and Swedish, wrote down a sacramental manual for the dying in the Catharite sect. Now, what is the Catharite sect? You're probably familiar with something called the Albigensian Crusade. This was not a crusade carried on against the infidel for the recovery of Jerusalem, but rather a series of military actions carried on by the Pope against communities in southern France in the early 1200s. And these people were Catharites. They were, as far as we can tell, and we can't tell much because we only have descriptions of the Catharites written by the people who were burning them at the stake. In other words, no original Catharite documents survive. We just have what they screened out on the rack as they were being put to death by the bishops of the church. And this was a horrific incident in European history. To give you the flavor of it, the second Albigensian Crusade was prosecuted by a general of the Pope named Simon de Montfort. And his lieutenants came to him at a point, and some of you may have visited the city of Carcassonne in southern France, which is a walled medieval city, very beautiful. And Simon de Montfort's lieutenants came to him and told him, they said, we have cornered the Catharites at Carcassonne, but the problem is there are 6,000 Catholics within the city walls. And he said, kill everybody. God will recognize his own. So that was the spirit in which this thing went forward. And they did. They did. So what we do know about the Catharites is that they had a sacrament, the holiest, well first let me tell you a little bit more about them. At first it was thought that they were pretty much heterodox Christians. They were into nudity and vegetarianism. They sounded like early hippies as far as we can tell. They got together, men and women, and they took off their clothes, they bathed, whether there were orgies or not, we don't know. They were vegetarians. And the one thing we do know is that they had a sacrament called the Consolamentum. And the Consolamentum was, it was a ritualized vivisection, or not vivisection, the term escapes me, but anyway, when you were dying, a fellow catheter would cut your wrists and open your veins in a warm bath of water, and you would die in that state. You did not die a natural death, and this was called the consolamentum. Well, what Leo Levitoff is claiming is that the Vonage manuscript is a description, a manual, for the perfecti of the catheterized sect, telling how to properly carry out the consolamentum. And I see no reason to challenge it, I mean, even with my limited knowledge of German, once you get the vowel and the letter assignments right into this weird manuscript, into this weird language, and change it into English text, or, you know, alphabetic text is what I'm trying to say, you can see that there's enough German there, and then these loanwords in Flemish, and so forth, it looks to be true, and what emerges from this, if we accept the Vonage manuscript as the only primary document on the catheterized faith, is that this was not a form of heterodox Christianity at all. It was much more radical than that, and this may explain the church's fury at this group of people. It was a cult of Isis. It can be traced straight back into the mystery religions of Eo-Isis in Egypt, and I have not seen any critical commentary on Levitoff's work. His book was published by this weird press in Redondo Beach that specializes only in books on military encryption. I mean, their catalog is a revelation to see. I mean, it's amazing, and the book on the Vonage manuscript stands out like a sore thumb, because most of it is like three-letter dictionaries of three-letter words in Swahili, and their numerical transforms and stuff like that. So that's the history to date of the Vonage manuscript, and it's not that askew of our subject, because all of this heterodoxy in Europe blends together. The presence of Theodor Debray as an alchemical printer in Heidelberg may be a clue, because there were survivals of this catheterized faith in the form of a heresy called the Brotherhood of the Free Spirit. If any of you are familiar with the altarpiece called The Garden of Earthly Delights by Hieronymus Bosch, it's thought that this was created by commission for a congregation of the Brotherhood of the Free Spirit. And the Brotherhood of the Free Spirit was always associated, for some reason, we don't know why, with printers. Printers seemed to be the profession that the Brotherhood favored, and like the catheterized faith, practiced ritual nudity, vegetarianism, and gathering together in a ritual bath. If they would just let go of the whole idea complex, they would be liberated from this kind of minutia. So, belief kills the spirit. The spirit transcends belief. So I wanted to say that. Then, someone asked about Bruno and V. Since I suggested you read Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition, it's ironic that so little time was spent on Bruno. But on the other hand, I recommended you read the book so you should be well informed on Bruno. For me, Bruno, we just didn't get into that particular historical episode because I wanted to tell you about the Rosicrucian Enlightenment. But the thing to remember about Bruno is his discovery of the infinitude of the cosmos. And that by an act of unencumbered observation. I mean, how many people had looked at the night sky before Bruno and they had not seen what he saw, which was infinite space. And suns hung like lamps unto the uttermost extremes of infinity. By an act of pure cognition, he was able to destroy an entire cosmological vision that had limited and confined the human soul for millennia. That's half of his story. The other half is he was burned at the stake for refusing to back down from this. And it's a model for us all that trust your perception, trust your intuition, and then accept the consequences. Because this is what existential validity must be. As far as the relationship between Di and Bruno, the relationship is that they were both derivatives of the magical school that can be traced back to Henry Cornelius Agrippa von Nettlesheim, who was another model for Faust. Agrippa wrote De Libre Quatro, De Occultate Philosophia, four books of occult philosophy. And that was the core work for European magic. All magic is derivative, all European magic can be traced back to the Agrippan system. And Agrippa was the direct student of the Abbot Trithemius of Sponheim that we mentioned yesterday as the source of all the magical codes in the Middle Ages. If you're interested in a brilliant but fictional treatment of John D. and Giordano Bruno, I'd like to recommend a novel to you. It's called Egypt, spelled A-E-G-Y-P-T. It has the A in front of the E. It's by John Crowley, the same gentleman who wrote Little Big, which is a wonderful novel about the magical interface between two worlds. But his book Egypt, fully half of the book is given over to a wonderfully rich retelling of the relationship between Bruno and Di. Now some people have wanted to say that Di and Bruno actually crossed physical paths in London, but I've looked into it and they missed each other for about two weeks. Bruno was setting sail for England as Di was setting sail for France in the Rosicrucian Enlightenment episode that I talked about. Then someone asked about Tantra and the contrast between the imaginative, internalized invocation of the animus or the animus, depending on your own sexuality, and that contrasted with something which actually happens between two people. We didn't talk that much about the concept of the chemical wedding, or the alchemical marriage is another way of putting it. But this is the Western resonance to the Eastern idea of Tantra, and it is the idea that sexual energy being the rawest and most accessible energy to the organism can be channeled into a higher spirituality. Well, it's entirely so. The problem is, of all paths, this is probably fraught with the greatest difficulty, because sexuality is such a debased coinage in the modern world. In other words, you have to make your way with great care and great purity of intent into this. In Eastern Tantra that is actually practiced in a physical manner, usually the admonition is that you should have no attachment to your tantrika, that the relationship should be entirely given over to the technical details of this union. And, of course, it has to do with the forestalling of orgasm and the raising of energy within the organism. In the chemical marriage, in the alchemical marriage, due honor is given to the importance and uniqueness of the other person. In other words, it isn't the idea of the temple prostitute who serves as the vessel for this process. But there's actually an effort to keep individual identities and individual dignity, in some sense, together. And this is, you know, the higher up the mountain you go, the steeper it becomes. And when you begin to scale the height of alchemical or tantric sexuality, the fall back into the negredo can be shocking indeed. So that's just an admonition. It's not designed to scare you off. It's just to say that in an age of sexually obsessed as our own, you have to, as the I Ching says, inquire of the oracle once again, if you have purity of intent. Okay. Yeah, great. So the healing between the two? Yes, it's a complete alchemical system, and the energy is passed between. This is probably the highest completion that is possible. You know, the idea of romantic love, I mean, I don't want to digress too much into this, but the idea of romantic love was introduced into Europe in the 1400s and earlier at the Angervine court of Eleanor of Aquitaine by troubadours. And this troubadour tradition, scholarship now reveals pretty convincingly that this is an esoteric Sufi system. It also occurs in Indian teachers such as Chaitanya. You know, Chaitanya is the guy who the Hare Krishnas go back to, but the radical teaching of Chaitanya was that you could achieve ecstasy not by sitting in yoga, but by dancing and singing on street corners. And it's now pretty clearly shown that the penetration of Sufi ideas into Bengal was happening at the same time that these Sufi ideas were coming across from North Africa and into Spain and southern France. So it's a tremendously old and vital tradition, but you have to be very careful. The romantic impulse is a real double-edged sword. It has been ever since the early 19th century, because you see, the rise of romanticism, as that term is normally understood, meaning the movements in art and literature of the early 19th century, the rise of romanticism was a response to the dehumanization that was going on at that time, the rise of industrialism and the further retreat into cities more massive than any that had ever been built before. Did you want to say something? I was going to add that the question was about healing, and I think there's a tremendous difference between the Indian and Tibetan country systems in order to practice endowism in terms of dual cultivation or single cultivation. In our system, certainly, self-healing is of paramount importance before you can even consider dual cultivation. Then, again, other considerations come in, but certainly in the Indian and Tibetan systems where Dakinis and various deities are invoked in the process of their alchemical union, it's really quite different from the Daha system, which is devoid of belief in God. Yeah, that's a good point. You know, I talked yesterday about the alchemical stages. When you have reached the final whitening of these processes, that final whitening is, from a higher perspective, a new negrito, and you must always build and build again. You have to be fairly confident that you have already realized a certain portion of yourself before you then embark on these tantric double experiments, because a lot of tantric text reads very vampire-radical. I mean, it's all about expelling the semen and then sucking it back in, and it's like an energy war. It turns into black magic. The losing partner in these deals has just left a wizard husk, and this is not a higher completion to be sought for. You're correct that there is. In fact, there are supposedly, whether they're myths or documented stories about one Chinese empress who caused the death of more than a thousand men because of her vampirism. And it was sexual in nature. It was sexual in nature. Okay, then a couple of other points here, and then we'll break up. The gentleman here who had nothing to comment or wanted to sit it out reminded me, since we were talking about the Valentinian system this morning, my favorite archon, aside from Sophia, who's so interesting because of the little story about how she made the universe. But the twelfth archon in the Gnostic system is a unique entity. I don't know of another religious system that has this notion. The twelfth archon in the Valentinian system is called the Watcher, and that's all he does. He does not input into the system at all, but is the witness, and somehow then this creates a validating dimension that is very important. So I just want to affirm that the Watcher is a very strong platform on which to stand. I mean, wood that I could learn to keep my mouth shut, wood that we all could. So the Watcher is a good archon to keep active on your inner altar. So then, the future occurs three times in the list, and we don't have a lot of time, but what I would like to say about it this morning is, if you extrapolate all that has been said here, then you should see that, remember how I said that one view of alchemy was that the alchemist intervened in natural process in the role of a catalyst. For those of you who aren't chemists, a catalyst is something which causes a chemical reaction, which is going on anyway, to proceed at a faster rate. But the catalyst is not consumed in this process. It simply accelerates it. And if we think of nature as a great alchemical furnace that continuously produces and brings forth wonders, then must it not be that humanity is the yeast of the Gaian alchemical rarefaction, and that human history is the process of catalyzing the alchemical condensation? If we look back into nature before the advent of speaking and writing human beings in the last 15,000 years, what we see are very leisurely processes. I mean, the speciation of a single plant from another can occupy 50 or 60,000 years. It never happens more quickly than that. And the grinding down of glaciers from the poles, these are processes that take hundreds of thousands of years. With the advent of human beings, an entirely new ontos of becoming, an entirely new category of becoming is introduced into the entire cosmos, as far as we know, because we cannot verify that there are other self-reflecting beings in the universe. And this new ontos of becoming is what I call epigenetic, as opposed to genetic. All other change in the living world, in the world of bios, of zoa, occurs through genetic change. Random modification of the genome, which is then subject to random selection. But with the advent of speech and writing, epigenetic means outside genetics. Epigenetic processes become possible, and time accelerates. One way of thinking about what is happening in this cosmos is that it is a gradual conquest of dimensionality by becoming or process. I mean, we hardly have a word inclusive enough. The earliest forms of life were probably slimes on certain kinds of clay, self-replicating molecular systems. And then certain portions of this chemistry became light sensitive. And then there was the sense of the division between light and darkness, which generated the notion of here and there on some tremendously basic level within these early organisms. Once you have the concept of here and there, motility, the ability to move, the cilia that dot the surfaces of protozoans and stuff like this are elaborated. And a new dimension enters the picture, the dimension of time. Because notice that a journey from here to there is a journey from now to then. And then as more refined perceptual apparatus arose, and more refined systems of moving animal bodies arose, a steady conquest of dimensionality occurred. The movement of animals onto the land and so forth. Well then, with the advent of memory, and memory must be mediated by language except at a very crude, instinctual level, memory is a time-binding function. It's a way of somehow taking the past and calling up its essential properties so that they are co-present with the given moment of experience. And when you, it's one thing at the level of the song and dance of pre-literate peoples, but once you begin to chisel stone and write books, then you're into the epigenetic domain in a big way. And once you cross the threshold into the world of electronic media and that sort of thing, once you achieve powered flight, once you can hurl instruments outside the solar system, these are time-binding functions. And the alchemical intent, recall, was to accelerate nature's intent toward perfection. And the alchemists all believed that nature was growing toward a state of unity and perfection, and given millions and millions of years, everything would turn to gold. Everything would find its way toward the Plotinian One. So, now we live in a world that appears to be on the brink of its own death or extinction and the reason we make that assumption is because our bridges are burning behind us. We see no way back to the world of the hunting and gathering pastoralists of the high paleolithic of the Saharan grasslands. We see no way back to the gothic piety of a Europe with under 30 million people in it. Our bridges are burning and our religions, Islam, Judaism, Christianity, the major western religions persistently insist that we are caught in a tightening spiral of ever-increasing speed that is carrying us toward an unimaginable confrontation with something which they call God, the second coming, the messiah, you name it. As cool-headed a rationalist as Arnold Toynbee, when he sat down to write a study of history, he finally had to face the question, what is history for? And the best he could come up with is, history must be about the entry of God into the domain of three-dimensional space. Well, we don't know what God is, let's not call it God, let's call it the philosopher's stone, let's call it the Sophic Hydrolith. And I believe that the chaos of our world, the apocalyptic intuition that informs our religions and our dreams is because ahead of us in time, and now not that far ahead of us in time, is something which, taking a page from the mathematical concern called dynamics, we can call an attractor. The attractor lies ahead of us in time. Universal process is not driven by a downward cascade of Cartesian casuistry, that's the scientific notion, and it leads to a universe of entropy and heat death millions of years in the future. But what we see around us is a continuing and accelerating complexification as human beings, machines, ecosystems, the solar system itself is beginning to knit itself into a tighter and tighter organization. I believe that alchemy provides the best metaphors for understanding this. Nature is the great alchemist par excellence, and we as its minions through history are accelerating the condensation of being toward the unimaginable. So that in my system, my way of thinking, there's ultimately a symmetry break with ordinary history, and I call it all kinds of different things, but here this morning, the transcendent other. The transcendent other casts an enormous shadow across the lower dimensional landscape of time. The stirring of the earliest life forms in the Devonian seas caught the call, and every step that has been taken since then has been ever quicker, ever quicker toward the transcendental other. It beckons us, and history is haunted by this thing. History is the shockwave of eschatology. History is a process that lasts, let's be generous, 25,000 years, the wink of an eye in geological time. And in that 25,000 years, religious systems rise and fall, governmental systems, teachers come and go, and there is a sense of being caught in a whirlpool that is spinning us toward fusion with the unimaginable. And this is why the skies of Earth are haunted by flying saucers. They aren't coming from other solar systems. They are scintillas, remember this alchemical term, sparks, they are scintillas being thrown off from the alchemical quintessence which lies like a great attractor at the end of time. And the purpose of science and technique and electronic media and information transfer and all of this stuff is to knit us together, to dissolve our boundaries and to bring us to a point of singularity where language fails, where we lean over meaning's edge and feel the dizziness of things unsaid. And this lies now, I believe, within our lifetimes, within the lifetime of most of us, this is actually going to break through. I mean I'm like one of those people carrying a sign that says repent for the end is near. It's as nutty a position as you can possibly hold. That's why I suspect it has a reasonable chance of being dead on. So, that is the point of talking about alchemy and this melding and the production of the quintessence and all that. It is because we are a mass eyelash away from a full confrontation with the transcendent other. Our dreams are haunted by it. Our reveries are filled with it. If we take a psychedelic drug, it is revealed before us in all its splendor. This is the force that is pulling us inexorably toward completion. I remember once in a psilocybin trance, I expressed concern about the state of the world and the noose spoke, the logo spoke, and it said, no big deal. This is what it is like when a species prepares to depart for the stars. We are in the birth canal of a planetary birthing. As you know, if you come upon a birth in progress, you would never dream that this is the culmination of a natural process. It looks like a catastrophe of some sort. There is moaning and groaning and screaming and thrashing and blood is being shed, and there is a feeling of the walls are closing in, and yet it is inscripted into each of us as a microcosmic reflection of the completion of human history, and not only human history because we are simply the hands and eyes of all life, all process on this planet. The Gnostics believe that the earth is like an egg, and that a moment will come when the egg must be split asunder. I love to quote the Grateful Dead, you can't go back and you can't stand still. If the thunder don't get you, then the lightning will. That is what we are being funneled toward. That is the message of alchemy. That is the quintessence and perfection of the human enterprise, the biological enterprise. I like to recall the Irish toast, may you be alive at the end of the world, and we have a real crack at it. It is not a pessimistic vision, it is the most optimistic vision that one can suppose, and I think that is where I would like to leave it this morning. There is much still to be learned and still to be teased apart in the art history and the history of heterodox thinking in Europe, of which alchemy then is seen to be one facet of a faceted gem that includes the Brotherhood of the Free Spirit, early Freemasonry, Catharites, survivals of Manichaeanism, in Yugoslavia there are Bogomilvostrian graves on the southern coast of Thessalonica, and just a whole zoo of intellectual systems that have been forgotten and overlooked. This is what I meant when I said we will explore the stratigraphy of lost thought systems, and in some cases we possess quite complete skeletons. In the case of alchemy, in the case of the Bogomils and the Cathars, what we possess is almost a foot bone, or a tooth, or a footprint. But someday, with luck, new textual material will emerge, and a new understanding of the role of heterodoxy in the formation of modern thought will emerge. Questions? Yes. Last year, the book on Freemasonry was just recently published, and I just about finished it. I think that this person who will be working with your story on alchemy in this country, and I think it's what it's all about, Freemasonry as a whole, which is a very interesting industry. Yes, you make an interesting point. John Glauus brought me an article yesterday, you know, we're all tied up now in this Pluto return. I'm not an astrologer, but John brought me an article talking about how, I don't know whether it was the last time or the time before last that the Pluto return occurred. It is precisely the 1490s, the period that we're talking about when the Corpus Hermeticum was translated. And we are now in a period that is astrologically exactly equivalent to that period, and the Vonage manuscript appears to have been deciphered. I mean, I'm willing to accept it. You mentioned this revelation of the true nature of Freemasonry, and of course what is going on at the moment that is askew of our subject but tremendously exciting and relevant to the idea of lost knowledge coming to light is that this is the golden moment in Mayan studies. It is happening right now, day by day, hour by hour, minute by minute, the logjam has been broken, the Mayan glyphs are being deciphered, no shit. And it has to do with an entirely new approach that some Russian linguists have taken, and if any of you are interested, it will never happen again. So far as I know, there are now, with the Mayan decipherment, no real undeciphered languages left. The Harappan script was deciphered a few years ago, but really it wasn't that interesting because we only possess something like 6,000 characters in Harappan. But the literature of the Maya, when you take not only the hieroglyphic, the stone texts, but when you add in the ceramic texts, we have a lot of Mayan material, and it is being deciphered at a furious rate. If you're interested in this, Linda Shiel has written a book called The Forest of Kings, and what a, how I do envy this woman, because what she is doing is writing the first history of the Maya in a thousand years. This is not, we're not now dealing in the realm of gods and myths, we're dealing with stuff like on the 14th of May, 642, an army from El Caracol met an army from Tikal and triumphed and deposed three flint and placed on the throne. It's this kind of stuff, real history, and the conceits of Mayan religion and Mayan courtly life are all coming into focus, and it's very exciting. It's all these people who have tried to make the Maya into some kind of Atlantean civilization should be running for cover at this point, because the picture that emerges is not as pretty as we might wish, but hey, know the truth, and the truth shall set you free. I would choose truth over illusion any time, no matter how damaging it might be to somebody's conceptions of these things. So, and if any of you are interested in these subjects, another area where this has occurred is some of you may know the book by Michael Chadwick called The Decipherment of Linear B. Linear B is a Proto-Minoan language, and a linguist at Cambridge named Michael Ventris of a genius in the 50s took this language. There was no Rosetta Stone. This is the amazing thing. You know what I mean by a Rosetta Stone? You see, in the 19th century, the great mystery was how to read the Egyptian hieroglyphs, and before they were deciphered, the Egyptians were treated like the Maya, and people thought that the secrets of the universe were chiseled on those obelisks and tombs. Well, then, a scholar in the Grand Army of Napoleon, Champion, was a soldier found a tablet which had a column of Demotic Greek, a column of another language, I forget which one, and a column of Egyptian hieroglyphs, and they were able to realize that it was saying the same thing three times, and that opened it up for them. But that's like a crib sheet, because it's easy if you have the same text in a known language, but in the case of the Maya, and in the case of Linear B, and in the case of Harappan, there was no Rosetta Stone. Well, then you talk about an excruciatingly difficult problem to solve, and I'll explain to you how it was done with the Maya, because it's so neat. It turns out that Mayan is a rebus language. What does this mean? Do you remember when we were kids, and in comic books, there would be these things where it would show a picture of an eye, and then it would show a picture of a saw going through a log of wood, and then it would show a picture of an ant, and then it would show a picture of a red rose. This is a sentence which says, I saw Ant Rose. But now notice what's going on here. It's all based on puns that depend entirely on a knowledge of the spoken language. If you lose the sounds of the spoken language, how the hell could you ever tell that a picture of an eye, a saw, an insect, and a rose says, I saw my maternal relative on my mother's side. I mean, it just is impossible. It's absolutely impossible in that situation to reconstruct meaning unless you have the sounds. Well, how do you recover the sounds of a language dead a thousand years? Well, these Soviet linguists had the good sense to go and look at living Mayan languages, of which there are 15 living Mayan languages in the Americas, and they discovered one of these dialects where when you set Mayan hieroglyphs in front of these people and they named what they saw, meaning came out of their mouths, and that broke the logjam, and then, you know, you just rev up your computers and use all the standard tools of modern linguistics and philology, and the stuff just begins to pour out clear as day, no problem. If they asked the Mayan, yes, they had to go to the Mayan. You're right. Good point. It never occurs to them. Because always before when they would show this stuff to Mayans, they would say, what does it mean? Instead of saying, what do you see here? And then when they said what they saw, meaning came out of their mouths. So it was very, very neat. It shows once again the hubris of modern scientific methods, but we tend to dismiss the aboriginal and the primitive. I mean, this was to turn it toward my own favorite subject. This was the state of modern medicine. Nobody would ask people in the Amazon Basin, you know, what plans do you use for malaria, brain tumor, shrinkage, and so forth and so on, because they were just dismissed as superstitious primitives. It was thought that the doctrine of signatures was operating. They didn't realize how subtle and how complete human knowledge systems grow under the care of those people for whom it really matters. Is there anything that needs to be said about this? The redemption, the project of the redemption of spirit from matter turned into the project of redeeming the general society of the time toward the utopian vision. And this is working right up until the present. Millenarianism is still with us. Marxism is the last great millenarian faith, you know, the belief in the worker's state. It occupies the same relationship to these alchemical utopias as Heideggerian existentialism has to second-century Gnosticism. The poetry has gone. The Baroque filigree has been stripped away. But the impulse is still toward a perfect society where each, from his ability, according to his needs and means. And it lives on. I mean, democracy is also an effort, let us not forget, to recapture the style of fifth-century Athens. And we forget that this was a city-state half of whose inhabitants were slaves. And yet we are so under the spell of the utopian dream that we continue, and not without important reason, I think, to try to labor toward a just and decent world where the lamb lies down with the lamb. And that was and it remains the alchemical dream. One thing that occurs to me to say, I once, in one of these revelatory dialogues with the Logos, asked the question, why me? Why are you telling me this? Because I was a poor hippie, I was penniless, I was a traveler. And the answer was instantaneous. It was because you don't believe in anything. Because you don't believe in anything. And I think that that's a very pure position to hold. We're not trying to ensnare you to abandon your Jewishness or your Presbyterian-ness or belief. If you believe in something, you have precluded the possibility of believing in its opposite. And you have hence limited your freedom. Everything is to be judged by its efficacy, by its effectiveness in the real world. And I think that I have a horror of all belief systems. I just don't like them. If somebody tells you they have the answer, leave from this person. They are obviously some kind of low being who has not at all recognized the true size and dimension of the cosmos that we're living in. And if you can keep yourself free of encumbering beliefs, then your dialogue with the Logos can go forward unhindered. Sometimes when I am in the trance of psilocybin, I will say to the entity, Begin to show me yourself as you are for yourself. Don't give me the scaled-down humanized version. Begin to show your true nature. And after a few moments of that, then I have to raise my hand and say, You know, I can't handle more than that. This goes back to the statement made yesterday or the day before about that the universe is not only stranger than we suppose, it's stranger than we can suppose. Therefore, we are given tremendous latitude in what we think and what we conceive. And if you begin to believe something, then you are pulled down because every belief has consequences, you know. I mean, a perfect example is, as some of you may know, when Muhammad ascended into heaven from the site of what was to become the Mosque of Omar, from the site of the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem, he happened to be on horseback. Well, if you believe Muhammad ascended into heaven, imagine the theological and hermeneutic problems posed by the horse he was riding, because it went with it. This is a perfect example of how intellectual baggage drags us down because belief always then contains absurdity. I mean, the theological status of this horse has troubled Islamic theologians for centuries.

## **1992**


We've probably staved off serious work just about as long as we can, unless someone insists. No. Okay. Well, today's thing is sort of a return to a more orthodox, educational kind of mode, hopefully not to such a degree that it's boring. But the agenda is to talk about Hermeticism and alchemy, the way in which this tradition, which is counterintuitive and heterodox, if not heretical from the point of view of Christianity, and what it can mean for the present, what it means for the psychedelic experience, what it means for the notion of the end of history, and how the loss of this point of view has probably done us a certain amount of damage. The great tension in the Middle Ages was between the magical schema, the magical view of human beings, and the Christian view. And the Christian view is very strongly marked by the idea of man's fall, that we screwed up early on, and somehow then, by virtue of that, were forced into a secondary position in the cosmic drama. We are doing penance as we speak. The world is a veil of tears. The loss of human beings is to till hard land, and we are cursed until the 19th generation, or something like that, by the fall of our first parents. And we can be redeemed, this is, I'm giving you the Christian rap, we can be redeemed through Christ, but we don't deserve it. If you are saved, it is because there is a kind of a hand extended to you from a merciful God, who is willing to overlook your wormy nature, and draw you up in spite of yourself. And this is deep in us, no matter how, you know, whether you're, you may not think you've bought in because you're black, or because you're Chinese, or something, but it's just in the air we breathe. It's what Western civilization makes you think, whether you want to think it or not. You know, even if you don't come out of these traditions, and trust the concept that you've got to pay your dues, human beings are co-partners with deity in the project of being. This is the basis of all magic. You see, in a Christian context, magic is heresy, because it implies that man can command God to act. In other words, that in some strange way, the magician compels nature to behave as the magician desires. In Hermeticism, it isn't so much put in terms of compel, but the idea is that humanity, human beings, men and women of great spiritual accomplishment, are co-partners in the project of being, and that God, as it were, stepped off the stage of creation with it only 90% completed, and the rest is left in the hands of his brother. Hermetica actually refers to humanity as the brother of God. So it's a completely different attitude toward being human. It's an empowering attitude. With power comes the potential to abuse power, because you're no longer a worm. You remember that image in Jonathan Edwards' sermon, Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God, where he says you're like a worm suspended over an abyss, held there only by the love of a merciful God, implying that if he weren't a merciful God, he'd just let go of your thread and you'd go down the tubes. In the Hermetic magical view, human beings are not tainted by original sin, and no ideology is without the potential of abuse. The Hermetic attitude in the Renaissance was summed up in a single aphorism by the great Renaissance Platonist Marcello Ficino, and what he said was, and I have to, you know, there's no sexism in all of this, you just have to realize these guys were primitive types and they hadn't confronted the political issues we've confronted. So when they say man, they mean humanity. The Renaissance magical attitude is summed up in Ficino's aphorism, man is the measure of all things. And this is a double-edged sword, because in a single affirmation, you cast off the guilt trip, you cast off the view of ourselves as a flawed creature. But when you say man is the measure of all things, I mean, you could be the chairman of the board of Louisiana Pacific or Dow Chemical. I mean, this is approximately their attitude. In other words, it ain't rainforests, it's not the life of the earth, it's none of that malarkey, we are to be the measure of all things. So it has to be tempered. We'll probably end up talking a bit here about the pathological expression of the hermetic position, which is called Faustianism. And Faustianism is where you have unbridled ego, unbridled faith in the intellect, so that you proceed forward without self-doubt. If you haven't read Faust recently, it's a surprising read. First of all, it's very funny. It's hilarious. It's funnier than any of Shakespeare's plays, I think. And the way it ends is the guy dedicates himself to land reclamation and the draining of swamps to build low-cost housing for poor people. And people don't know this. They're caught up in the images of the center of the story, where magical power is running rampant. But Faust's final conclusion is that he should do some good work for the least of society and give up these Promethean and titanic dreams of the mastery of power. Well, a little bit of history about this hermetic ideal. It's an interesting story in the light of our discussion of time yesterday. Western civilization, in a way, can be thought of as an accumulated series of misunderstandings. And one of the most severe of these misunderstandings has to do with this whole business of hermeticism. The Renaissance really believed that Hermes Trismegistus was a great teacher of antiquity who preceded Moses, who was in time older than Moses. And they had what they called the Prisci Theologica, the three theologians, and they were Hermes Trismegistus, Moses, and Orpheus, in that order. And the reason that I say Western civilization is built on a series of misunderstandings is because they got it all wrong about Hermes Trismegistus. And there was great confusion and unhappiness in the 16th century when Marie Cassabon, who was an early philologist, attacked the dating of the hermetic corpus and argued correctly that this could not possibly have been written in a period preceding Moses, that, in fact, this was post-Christian, written no earlier than the first century A.D. This is the equivalent of us finding out that, you know, George Washington was alive in Greenwich Village in the 1930s or something. I mean, it was a completely mind-bending realignment of how people thought the history of the world had unfolded because they had, up to that time, thought that when you studied Hermes Trismegistus, you were reading the oldest philosopher in human history. Actually, it's very late. And, in a way, this is what destroyed the magical alternative, that the advent of modern philology showed that these so-called ancient texts were not ancient at all. They were late Roman. They were Hellenistic. And so strongly was imprinted in the Western mind what's called, and we've talked about it here this weekend, what's called the nostalgia for paradise. In other words, the belief that the older it is, the better it is. And Guillaume-Baptiste Avico in La Scienza Nuova laid the basis for this kind of thinking. It's called classicism in the Renaissance context. So once they found out that the Hermetic Corpus had been written in late Roman times, it was like it was finished. And science was able to use the confusion in the magical community at that point to force its own agenda very strongly. And there have been numerous episodes of misplaced dating like this that have contributed to the confusion around the history of magic. For example, and I hope this doesn't bring somebody rising out of their chair in an air-clawing rage, but Rosicrucianism rests on a whole bunch of phony dates because they want to tell you that somebody named Christian Rosenkranz wrote a book called The Chemical Wedding and sealed it up in a time capsule in the 12th century and that it was then dug up in the 15th. 15th? 16th. Dug up in the 16th century. But actually all these Rosicrucian documents were ponied up by people in the 16th century who had a very complicated political agenda, which we will probably discuss as part of this weekend. Hermetic philosophy is based on what is called the Hermetic Corpus. This is a group of books, the most important of which is called the Asclepius. And these books, most of them, were completely lost during the Middle Ages. At the fall of the Roman Empire, copies of these Hermetic manuscripts were systematically destroyed by enthusiastic Christian barbarians. And the Hermetic manuscripts were scattered and they only survived then in monasteries in Syria and places like that. Well then, in the Renaissance, the Council of Florence, under the patronage of the Borgias and people like that, there was this great interest suddenly in antiquities because these Roman statuary and stuff was coming out of the ground. So the Council of Florence commissioned a character named Gemistus Pletho to go to Syria and bring back these manuscripts and they established a translation commission. And they had in manuscript the works of Plato, the works of Hermes Trismegistus, a whole bunch of ancient literature. And to show you what the psychology of the Renaissance was, here they had Plato, which they hadn't been able to read for a thousand years, sitting there waiting for translation. And Cosimo de' Medici said to Marcello Ficino, Plato can wait. Translate the Hermetic corpus first. And so it was done. If you're interested in Renaissance Hermeticism, you can't do better than read Dame Frances Yates' book Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition. Well, I want to read you some of this stuff because it's very interesting and it has a modernity that is astonishing. It's also very psychedelic. Here's a little passage on the imagination. I'm reading from Book 9 of the Corpus Hermeticum in the Scott translation. This is a four-volume set. I only brought the text and translation volume. But if you read Greek, it's all here. If you don't, it's all here in English. But this will just give you a feeling for the approach. If then you do not make yourself equal to God, you cannot apprehend God, for like is known by like. Leap clear of all that is corporeal and make yourself to a like expanse with that greatness which is beyond all measure. Rise above all time and become eternal. Then you will apprehend God. Think that for you too nothing is impossible. Deem that you too are immortal and that you are able to grasp all things in your thought, to know every craft and every science. Find your home in the haunts of every living creature. Make yourself higher than all heights and lower than all depths. Bring together in yourself all opposites of quality, heat and cold, dryness and fluidity. Think that you are everywhere at once, on land, at sea, in heaven. Think that you are not yet begotten, that you are in the womb, that you are young, that you are old, that you have died, that you are in the world beyond the grave. Grasp in your thought all this at once, all times and places, all substances and qualities and magnitudes together. Then you can apprehend God. But if you shut up your soul and your body and abase yourself and say, I know nothing, I can do nothing, I am afraid of earth and sea, I cannot mount to heaven, I know not what I was nor what I shall be, then what have you to do with God? Your thought can grasp in good if you cleave to the body and are evil. Interesting. Very different from the humble yourself, hard labor, spun wool and watery beer approach of medieval Christianity. Here's an amazing passage. You know, people like to think people thought the world was flat until the Renaissance. This is an incredible psychedelic image of outer space that is 2nd century AD. Would that it were possible for you to grow wings and soar into the air, poised between earth and heaven, you might see the solid earth, the fluid sea and the streaming rivers, the wandering air, the penetrating fire, the courses of the stars, and the swiftness of the movement with which heaven encompasses all. What happiness were that, my son, to see all these born along with one impulse and to behold him who is unmoved, moving in all that moves, and him who is hidden made manifest through his works. And it goes on and on. It's very readable, it's very literary, it's highly poetic, it's a celebration of nature, the notion of sin is completely absent, and it rings with a kind of confidence, a kind of joy, that was completely running counter to the brimstone and damnation point of view of Christianity. Here's, to me, a psychedelic passage. But he who presents all things to us through our senses, and thereby manifest himself through all things, and in all things, and especially to those to whom he wills to manifest himself, begin then, my son Tot, with a prayer to the Lord and Father, who alone is good. Pray that you may find favor with him, and that one ray of him, if only one, may flash into your mind, so that you may have power to grasp in thought that mighty being. For thought alone can see that which is hidden, inasmuch as thought itself is hidden from sight. And if even the thought which is within you is hidden from your sight, how can he, being in himself, be manifest to you through your bodily eyes? But if you have power to see with the eyes of the mind, then, my son, he will manifest himself to you. For the Lord manifests himself ungrudgingly through all the universe, and you can behold God's image with your eyes, and lay hold on it with your hands. If you wish to see him, think on the sun, think on the course of the moon, think on the order of the stars. Who is it that maintains that order? The sun is the greatest of the gods in heaven. To him, as to their king and overlord and all the kings of heaven, yield place. And yet this mighty God, greater than earth and sea, submits to having smaller stars circling above him. Who is it, then, my son, that he always obeys with reverence and awe? Each of these stars, too, is confined by measured limits, and has an appointed space to range in. Why do not all the stars in heaven run like and equal courses? Who is it that is assigned to each its place, and marked out for each the extent of its course? And so forth. So it's a nature-oriented celebratory. It glories in the exercise of the mind. It is not doctrinal. It is not pietistic. It is magical, psychedelic, expansive. And I'm not implying that they used psychedelic substances. The evidence for that is incredibly murky and hard to get at, and probably they didn't. I mean, one of the real tragedies of Western history is that Western Europe is so poor in psychoactive plants. I mean, had Western Europe stayed in touch with the mystery religions of ancient Greece, Christianity would never have been able to force its agenda to the degree that it did. I think you can make an argument that there were psychedelic mysteries in Europe, probably up until the time of the fall of Eleusis. Hermeticism is only one heterodox strain among many that were in existence in Europe in the late Roman period, and that then partially survived into the Dark Ages. I mean, you have Neoplatonism, which is a group of philosophers in the 3rd and 4th century, Plotinus, Porphyry, Proclus, and that crowd. And they took Plato, the late Plato, and contorted that into a mystical doctrine of emanation. They were what are called emanationists. What this means is you start with, it's either called the one or the unnameable or Brahman Atman or something like that, and then you have a series of declensions into more and more material and more and more multiplistic expressions of being. These Neoplatonists were emanationists, and their theories about how the universe is constructed have become sort of the unconscious basis of all later magical speculation. They are the people who brought the angels into the picture so intensely, because they were trying to create a descending hierarchy of being from the most high down to the most low. And angels, once set in place, became a real problem for Christianity because they are not very easy to distinguish from the old stellar demons of paganism. Paganism was largely the belief that the power of the stars could be drawn down to earth through a series, through sympathetic magic, really. By setting up resonances in a ritual situation, you could draw the power of the stars down into your projects and your intentions. And the late Middle Ages was a period of intensely working out all the associations between minerals, colors, perfumes, plants, musical notes and styles, so that you could then bring together all these things for purposes of magical evocation. And if any of you are interested in this, the book to read, which will point you toward many other interesting books, is a wonderful book called Spiritual and Demonic Magic from Ficino to Campanella. Some of you may remember Campanella. Hell of a fighter. Anyway, hello? And in the Renaissance, you know, over a period of about three generations, this became a real problem because what starts out as angel magic ends up as out-and-out demonic conjuration. Something which I've noticed my 14-year-old son has an incredibly unhealthy interest in, which I did as well at his age. I hope it's not the family curse coming back. Yeah, so I mentioned the dating error. It was Lactantius, who was one of the fathers of the early church, one of the patristic writers, that generation of theologians that followed Christ who canonized the Christian religion. And he placed Hermes Trismegistus as older than Moses, older than Pythagoras, older than Plato. And then it wasn't until Marie Casabon corrected that problem. See, we forget how the really transformative breakthrough that was represented for Western Europe by the recovery of all of this ancient literature. It had been completely lost, and also a misimpression that probably needs correcting. I think most people who are not schooled in Western history think that the further back in time the more quote-unquote superstitious people were. This isn't actually the case. It isn't a case of the further back in time you go the more belief in demons, magical conjuration, and stuff like that you get. The 10th, 11th, and 12th centuries in Europe were periods of remarkable piety and intellectual cohesion. Of course, it was also some kind of a fascist nightmare. That's how they achieved it. They had stamped out paganism. They had pushed heresy and heterodox thinking to the very distant frontiers of the empire, of the Holy Roman Empire. People were not superstitious, and people were not obsessed with horoscopes and conjuration and this sort of thing. Where that all began, or where it reached its culmination, is in the 16th century. The 16th century, the 1500s, was the most magical obsessed century in the last 10. Alchemy and conjuration and talismanic magic and sympathetic magic, all of these things flourished really not as a throwback, but as a kind of prelude to modern science. Modern science is an incredibly demonic enterprise, and we will see, as we discuss this stuff, that in a curious and little, rarely discussed way, the program, the agenda of magical dissidents in Europe have been entirely achieved by the forces of what we call modernity. It's simply that it has been done in an entirely secular metaphor. I mean, if you take even the trivial belief about alchemists, that they were concerned with changing lead into gold, of course that isn't what it was about, but there were plenty of con artists running around on the periphery of these deeper scenes who were claiming they could change lead into gold. Well, in the 20th century, we routinely change lead to gold. You do it with neutron bombardment in particle accelerators, and of course it costs far more to do it than the worth of the gold that you get out, but that really wasn't the point, was it? It was to prove that it could be done. The dreams of creating the homunculus are dreams that dovetail directly into the aspirations of modern biology, genetics, so forth and so on. The great chain of being of Aristotle is animated, given the dimension of motion, and lo and behold, it becomes the Darwin-Wallace theory of evolution. Merciliot talks about this, about how all the alchemical dreams of the 15th and 16th century have been brought to fruition in the 20th century, but again, in the absence of magical rhetoric, but certainly in a spirit of magical and Faustian recklessness, for sure. I mean, this is scientists, you know, they claim such a devotion to truth that decency must never stand in the way, because they serve a higher god than human values. They serve the golem of the truth in some weird way that makes the truth okay, even if it kills you. I studied philosophy from Paul Feyerabend, and he used to say at the beginning of his epistemology 101 course, I will teach you to recognize the truth, and I will teach you to ask the question, what's so great about it? You know, I mean, so now you've got the truth, so what's so great about it? It was 1460 when these manuscripts were brought to Florence. Those of you with photographic memories can see the time wave signature as it turns over and heads through the floor, and Cosimo de' Medici immediately ordered Ficino to abandon his work on Plato, and the Paimander, which was one of these books, it was the only one which existed in Europe, even in partial form during the Dark Ages. Cosimo died in 1464, but the translation project went forward, and just so you understand, the tree, the developmental process in Western magic, basically all goes back to this Florentine translation project, and from there people who were well-placed got a hold of this stuff, the most important person probably being a person, certainly an unsung hero in the development of Western thought, Trithemius, Bishop of Sponheim, and Trithemius wrote a book, it was really a manuscript, it was never printed as a book in his lifetime, but later, called the Stenographica, and in it he put forth many of these magical doctrines, and also encryption methods for code-making and breaking, so that this stuff could be circulated under the eyes of the clergy without causing a problem. And then the development of Western magic splits into two strains, the Bruno strain, Giordano Bruno, I understand he's running for President of the United States this year, Giordano Bruno and his school, he was a Franciscan monk who ended up being burned at the stake, his sin for which he was burned at the stake was he was sitting on a rooftop of one of these Italian city-states one evening, presumably smoking some pretty decent boo that they brought in from North Africa, and he was looking at the stars, and it occurred to him, these things are suns, these little points of light are like the sun, Jesus Christ, and in a single moment, the universe became infinite, and he said, these are suns, and his mind was boggled, literally, can you imagine inside the medieval world view, where they have these concentric shells of angels and demons, suddenly this guy gets it in a single moment, and he sees that the universe is infinite, and he begins to say so, and this is against Aristotle, and the church just goes nuts, and they drive him out of Italy, and he has a whole bunch of adventures in England and other places, eventually he makes the mistake of coming back to a place in Northern Italy, where he is betrayed by his patron, and he is burned at the stake, for a point of view which all of us take quite for granted. The other strain of magic coming down from Trithemius is the Dee strain, and it is a bit more accessible to people like ourselves because John Dee was an Englishman, and he wrote in English, and so you don't have to conquer 16th century Italian or late Latin in order to read him, although he wrote a lot in Latin as well. Dee is a very interesting character worth spending some time on because Dee is the last person to be able to unify into one world view science and mathematics and magic and astrology all together, so he is the greatest magician of his age and the greatest scientist of his age. He designed the navigation instruments that Sir Francis Drake used to go around the Cape Horn and sail up the coast of California. Dee was an intelligence operative serving Queen Elizabeth on the European continent. He could cast the best horoscope in Europe, and that was his entree into these various royal families of these various capital cities of Europe, and then he was making maps of battlements and of the deployment of war facilities and ship building capacity and stuff like that and sending it all back to Elizabeth in these codes that he had learned from Trithemius, not personally, but from the Stenographica, and Dee, a very strange incident happened, which was on a cold day in April at his house in Mortlake, which is on the outskirts of London now, it's completely surrounded by modern London, I should say he had the largest library in England, he had 6,000 books, Sir Philip Sidney and the Queen would occasionally call upon him to shoot the bull, and he was a very learned man. So one day in April of 1582, he's working at his desk at his room in Mortlake, and he goes outside, there's some disturbance in the garden, and he goes outside, and his story, and we have only his story, is that an angel descended in a ball of light and gave him an object, which is to this day on exhibit in the British Museum, if you ever have a chance it's worth hunting it down, it's in the Renaissance Hall, and it's a piece of black polished obsidian, roughly about this big, and about that thick, and very highly polished, he called it the showstone, S-H-E-W, and what the deal was, was you could look into the showstone, if you had the right talent, and it was a magical theatre, there were gods and demons and female spirits and all kinds of things swirling around this thing, well for the next many years, the showstone was the major guiding force on Dee's life, and a guy came to him named Edward Kelly, and Edward Kelly, the legend has it that he had no ears, which in England at that time meant that you had committed some infraction in the province, and they had removed your ears, it was the mark of a con artist, so you couldn't fool anybody else, they took your ears off, so if you met somebody with no ears in a big scheme, you knew to keep your wallet in your pocket, so this guy Kelly had an immense facility with this showstone, I mean you could just sit down with it, and it is one of the most puzzling and undiscussed episodes in the evolution of western thought, the straight people just say, well this is a bunch of crap, you know this guy Kelly, first of all, Dee was married to a much younger woman named Anne Dee, and at one point in the ten years or so that Dee and Kelly were together, the angels of the showstone gave very explicit instructions that this guy was a sharpie for sure, however, it's very puzzling, because if he was a con artist, he must have been a con artist of immense cleverness, because often the way that the angels would work, is they would deliver very, very long messages in Latin, backwards, and Kelly would just dictate this stuff at a very rapid speed, and Dee would write it down, and then they would put away the showstone, and then they would very laboriously rewrite this stuff from back to front, and then there were long coherent harangues about what they should be doing, about which courtly figures they should support with money, and who should be introduced to who, it was very political, you know, what kind of a polymathic talent was Edward Kelly, that he could invert whole pages of Latin, and reel it off, and then have it be reconstructed, and make sense, also there are, you see, we know about this, because Dee kept a diary over the years that this was all going on, it's one of the most astonishing books in all of English literature, and until the last ten years, the 1658 edition was the only edition ever published, it's called A True and Faithful Relation, or in full, A True and Faithful Relation of What Passed for Many Years Between Dr. Dee and Some Spirit, with annotation by Marie Casabon, the guy who did the correct dating on Hermetica, and it's a very interesting reading, it's as I say, one of the most puzzling incidents in the whole history of science. What he was doing was, eventually, he came to rest at the court of Rudolf II, Rudolf I of Bohemia, who ruled from Prague. Now, you have to understand... Is that a handout? Yeah. Is there evidence of drug use? Not strong enough to warrant any getting thrilled about it. The great awareness of drug use came slightly later, and strangely enough, the drug was opium. It's interesting, the history of opium. You know, we think of opium and its derivatives, junk and heroin, as just the lowest... Well, maybe crack is now the lowest of the low, but anyway, it's a real scuzzball drug, according to most people's opinion. But did you know that nobody had been using opium for 3,000 years before anybody noticed that it was an addicting drug? It was not ever noted that opium was addicting until 1611, when John Playfair, a very famous English physician, wrote a book in which he commented on opium and said, Once one has begun the habit of opium, it must be maintained unto death. So, in the 30 years after D, there was a great hermeticist and alchemical thinker named Paracelsus, who arose on the European continent. Paracelsus is an interesting guy. He's essentially the inventor of drugs, because he was the first person to extract herbs and to get this notion of the essence, that if you have a medicinal plant, then there's something in there which you want to get out and concentrate. He called his school of alchemy, iatrochemistry, the doctor's chemistry. He invented pills of the ordinary sort, and he said, I have made a great discovery. The center of my alchemical opus rests with the magic of laudanum, which was, of course, gum opium. There was a craze in the late 15th century among alchemists for opium. The alchemist von Helmuth, he signed some of his alchemical tracts Dr. Opiatus. He was the first croaker. Somebody had a question? Yeah? What was the first fall of Eleusis? How did it go after that? The fall of Eleusis. Well, as you all probably know, Eleusis was a cult site near Athens on a plain. There's now a big lumberyard there, the last time I was there. But anyway, it was this plain, a very fertile plain outside of ancient Athens, and they celebrated the greatest of the Greek mysteries there. They celebrated, it was a bi-annual, I mean a twice yearly festival. In the spring, they would celebrate the lesser mystery, and it seemed to be a fairly local get-together of some sort, and probably a planting festival. But every September for 2,000 years, people from all over the Greco-Roman world would come for the festival at Eleusis. And the rule was, first of all, it was open to everyone. Men, women, free man, slave, everyone could attend. The rule was, you could only attend once in your life, and so you had one shot at whatever this thing was, and you were sworn to silence. And literally everyone who was anyone went to Eleusis to experience the mysteries. I mean, Herodotus, Thucydides, Plato, Aeschylus, Euripides, everybody. People would make journeys of thousands of miles. It was the wellspring of Greek spirituality. The problem is, we don't know with certainty what the excitement was all about. I mean, we know that there was an inner cult area called the Pelisterion, and that people would, that something was drunk, and that something was seen, and in the 19th century they just went nuts on this subject. I talk about it in my book, and they finally, all these constipated Victorian classicists decided that the Mystery of Eleusis must be a representation of the female genitals illuminated at the height of this ceremony by a laser light show of some sort, and so, you know, it was just absurd. I mean, it was a complete distillation of the Victorian mind being projected. I mean, you'd like to believe that the roots of Western civilization are deeper than a peep show, but, hey, who knows? There was a very interesting incident in, it's called the Scandal of 415, which is that in 415 B.C. a wealthy Athenian noble named Alcibiades was busted for, the charge was possessing the Eleusinian mystery and distributing it to guests at dinner. Well, this seems to make it fairly clear that this was not a clay representation of anybody's genitals. This was some kind of dope of some sort. So then the scholars whip out their knives, and all kinds of theories have been brought forward. Some of you may know that the scholar Robert Graves discusses this in The White Goddess, and his theory, which I think deserves to be more looked at than it has, his theory was that these recipes, people drank something from a special cup called a kekekeon, and that recipes supposedly exist for what they drank, and it's honey, barley, something else, and always water, and Graves argued that water is not something that you list as an ingredient of something you drink, obviously it has water in it, so he said the inclusion of water in this list is in order that there can be an agam, do you know what an agam is? You will when I tell you, because you've all seen them. An agam is when you make a list of things in such a way that the first letters spell out a word. So the idea was that in Demotic Greek, the words for barley, honey, water, and this fourth ingredient that I can't remember, those four words can be arranged to spell out the word miko, which means mushroom. So Robert Graves was convinced that a psilocybin mushroom lay behind the Eleusinian mysteries. This is a pretty good, this is not entirely unreasonable. Now, a few years ago, there was a book written by the great mushroom enthusiast and discoverer Gordon Wasson and the chemist who discovered LSD, Albert Hoffman, and the classicist Ruck. The three of them, and Jonathan Ott, I think, was also in there, wrote a book called Persephone's Quest, not Persephone's Quest, that's a different book, The Road to Eleusis, good, watch me, The Road to Eleusis, and they put forth there a new theory, which was that on the plain of Eleusis, they grew barley, and these people thought that there may have been a special strain of claviceps, do you all know what claviceps is? Do you all know what ergot is? Ergot is a smut, a smut is a disgusting disease, a fungal disease of grain. Have you ever been in a cornfield and seen an ear of corn that looks like it's covered with some black, slimy, horrible stuff that's flowing out of it and all over it, it's absolutely disgusting. Although, God, in California, I don't know if this has hit here yet, but in California for the past year, the hippest thing that you can be served at pretentious art openings and stuff like that is corn smut, which they spread on crackers, and it's just horrible, and it's really expensive, I mean, it's more expensive than caviar, and it's just become a craze, and I wouldn't get near it, I mean, it's not only disgusting to look at, but the chemistry of it is so weird, God alone, I mean, hives would be the least of your problems. Anyway, so corn smut, and there are rye smuts, and there are wheat smuts, but interestingly, the rye smut, which is ERGOT, is an organism called Claviceps phospholi, produces LSD-like alkaloids. And the problem is that LSD, ERGOT-related alkaloids, also very, tend to cause convulsions, or they can cause convulsions. If any of you suffer from migraine headaches, now there are a lot of different drugs for migraine, but up until just four or five years ago, the drug of choice for migraine was called ET, Ergonomine Tartrate. Ergonomine Tartrate, if you've got a kilo of it, you can settle down and make several million hits of LSD. Ergonomine Tartrate is this very rigidly controlled underground substance that is produced legally only in certain sanctioned fields in northern Pakistan, and it's produced for the world market of migraine sufferers. And you get these little tiny blue pills. I have migraines. I used to take ERGOT, but I don't, I've got it under control. But anyway, it's the drug of choice for migraine because it constricts the vessels, the blood arteries going into the head. Anyway, Wasson and Hoffman argued that what they were doing at Eleusis is that they were brewing an ERGOT beer. They were deliberately gathering barley that was infected with Claviceps, and they were brewing an intoxicating beer. And people were having a hallucinogenic experience. Well, now, this is a great area for the able-bodied among us to do research because it should be possible to collect Claviceps and maybe even to go to Eleusis and collect Claviceps there and culture it out and see if you could make an ERGOT beer that would actually get you hallucinogenically stoned. I'm not sure what's going on. ERGOT is a dangerous substance. I remember an anecdote once many years ago. I knew these people who occasionally dealt illegal substances, and one day they were moving some ET to somebody, and they asked this guy there if he would take this ounce of ET and deliver it to this certain address. And when they gave it to him, he said, now, this is ET, you know, so just leave it alone. And he got out in the car and he looked, he opened up the bag, and it was this white powder. And he said, you know, these people can't fool me. So he honked up a little of it, and then he went on his appointed rounds, and the guy who was supposed to have this delivered, he was sitting in his house, and he heard this commotion on his front porch and opened the door to find this guy flopping around with his legs and feet in the air having convulsive seizures because of the ET he'd snorted up. It's just one more story about the dangers of white powder drugs, folks. Anyway, it's important for the argument because I don't see how they could have been serving several thousand people of ergotized beer every September for 2,000 years and not have the Eleusinian Mysteries get a certain reputation for risk, you know, that people would have convulsions and conceivably even die of heart attacks. I mean, how could they get that many people loaded year in and year out and not get a bad rap on it? And then I talked to Albert Hoffman about this, and he didn't seem to feel that it was such a problem. He said that what you could do is float hot oil on the surface of this beer, and you could draw off the convulsive alkaloids, would have an affinity for the hot oil, and then you could just skim this oil off and discard it, and you would leave an hallucinogenic material in the beer. Well, I haven't tried this. Like I say, it's for the able-bodied. But in any case, this was the last outpost in the West of psychedelic mystery, and eventually those enthusiastic Christian barbarians appeared on the scene. In this case, it was Alaric the Visigoth, a great guy to take to an art museum. And, you know, they smashed it all to pieces. Alaric the Visigoth was kick-ass. People don't realize that these barbarian invasions of the late Roman Empire, the Vandals took over a huge swath of North Africa. They didn't just stop at the bottom of the Buce, Italy, or on the Peloponnesian Peninsula. These guys just kept rolling, and huge parts of Africa were under the control of Visigoths and Vandals. North Africa, the Carthaginian coast of the Mediterranean. And that killed, that was the end of the hallucinogenic mysteries. But it shows how late this mystical psychedelic impulse persisted in Western civilization. See, the thing that gave the Greeks their genius was that it was a mingling of a northern mentality coming out of Thracia and places like that, meeting a very old, mystical, feminist culture that had its roots 10,000 years deep in Saharan Africa, via Egypt and Cappadocia in Turkey, because it was said, even in classical times, what is celebrated in secret at Eleusis is celebrated publicly at Knossos in Mycenaea, in Minoan Crete. You see, Minoan civilization was an archaic civilization. It preserved the goddess worship, the opium use, all of these archaic styles were preserved in Minoan Crete for millennia after the rule on the coast of Asia Minor was kingship, bronze-tipped spears, city-building, and that whole sweat-socks mentality that built up there. And what finished those folks off was, around 950 AD, Mycenaean pirates eventually laid siege to these Minoan cities. And after centuries of slowly drifting deeper and deeper into opiated decadence, Minoan Crete fell. But all of the mysteries and the mysticism and the orgiastic rites and all of these archaic forms were then imported into Greece as mystery religions, as cult practices. One of the puzzles of Minoan religion is that they worshipped these things, or they had a religious relationship to these things called aniconic pillars. They're called what they are, mushrooms, as far as I can tell. They built shrines, they worshipped columns, but these columns were slightly flared on the top. As many of you are interested in, well, something that should be said, see, we have a distorted view of how culture developed and what classicism really meant, because for the past, throughout the 18th and 19th century, European scholarships spent a huge amount of time distorting and erasing the debt of Greek civilization to Africa. They basically screwed with the record because they just couldn't bring themselves to believe that all this wonderful architecture and proportion and mathematics, that it was little brown people who were responsible for this. And if you're interested in this, there's a book by Burnell called Black Athena that is a really radical book. Have any of you read it? It had quite a... It was very controversial a couple of years ago. Great book. Yeah. Black Athena by Burnell, and it shows how Western culture misrepresented the death of classicism to Africa. I mean, they could tolerate the idea of Egypt as long as you always made sure, you know, that these people were white as the driven snow. Well, it's a bunch of malarkey. I mean, it was a thoroughgoing black culture, and everything was derivative of it right up until, I don't know, the Byzantine Empire or something. I mean, Plato freely acknowledged his debt to this stuff. It was just... It was unswallowable to late European culture. Yeah. Oh, yeah. They did a cover thing on it. I didn't read it in time a few months ago. Yeah. What was it called? Our African Roots or something. Yeah. And there are... It's not... It's no shock and jive. I mean, we think 19th century scholarship was so careful and so wonderful, and what it really was was an old boys club. I mean, they were fast and loose with this stuff. You know, I think when it's all sorted out, it all happened in Africa. I mean, language, religion, symbolic activity, theater, all of this stuff was in place in Africa from, say, 20,000 B.C. up until around 9,000 B.C. in the Saharan grasslands, which then, because of drying, these people were forced into the Nile Valley and into a different cultural style. But the African cradle of civilization, I don't even regard that as a theory. Anybody who doesn't believe that is going to have to do some fast talking. And, you know, there's been this recent effort to say that the Australian aborigines broke off very, very early, but, you know, it's pretty specious, I think. You probably all know the theory of Eve and the fact that you can trace the maternal line through the epithelium of the mitochondria, so you can actually... It's actually now believed that every human being on Earth is descended from one woman, and this woman lived in Africa less than 200,000 years ago. You know, it's really amazing. All other human lines have been quenched somewhere along the line. Her progeny were phenomenally successful, and this is, I would say, now the strongest theory about this now is the Eve theory. When it was first propounded, it was thought to be the screwball, but that's because the physical anthropologists didn't really understand how the molecular geneticists achieved this conclusion. Once it was explained to everybody, it's pretty clear, you know, that we are all descended from one single female human being, not that there weren't other human beings, but she was embedded in as a society, but none of those lines of descent reached to the present. Yeah? Well, it was decadent in the sense that it went into a kind of a deep freeze. The level of change in the last thousand years of Minoan civilization, the dating of ceramic and stuff like that is almost impossible, because they were completely static. They were unchanging for a very, very long time in that late phase, and that's when these opium tallies were rising like crazy. Yeah? How did the Hermetica come into being? They were beginning to invent, in fact, the Casa Bones are considered to be the inventors of modern philology. Oh, is it? Interesting. I wonder if it was a soap job. Yeah, modern philology, and the way you do it is by interlocking textual reference and studying locution styles, and it was a tremendous shock to the Renaissance when they realized that what they thought was 5,000 years old was less than 1,000, or was about 1,000 years old, and that's what really discredited that whole worldview, which is in a way silly, because who cares how old it is? The question is, how much sense does it make? But the Renaissance was so strongly imbued with this belief that the ancient things were the better, that if something was shown to be not as old as previously thought, then it usually went on the discard pile. I think we lost ... Who were they? Yeah, the masters. It was Cosimo de' Medici, and that family, and the Borgias, but this family, there were I think 11 popes who bore the name Borgia in a hundred year period, so these people were very, very well connected. They were very wealthy. They had disposable income, which was something new in the world, and they invented a whole bunch of things, which God knows this city lives or dies by, like connoisseurship, patronage of the arts, and secular research projects. They were funding da Vinci's work on catapults and flying machines at the same time that they were keeping all these painters paid, and mistresses, and so forth. They were organizing archeological digs. People couldn't believe this stuff. We have assimilated all this, but they had forgotten the classical world, and they lived in places like Rome, and Naples, and Venice, but they had never dug, and they'd just been quarrying the Colosseum and stuff like that. Well, then when they began bringing this stuff out of the ground, and then the platonic corpus and all this, they just went ape for classicism, so ape that now we're this year celebrating the 500th anniversary of Columbus's voyage, which in a sense can be seen as the cherry on the top of the Renaissance mental explosion. We are still living in a classical world. We still react against classicism. The buildings we live in, the clothing we wear, our notion of how gentlemen behave, our attitudes toward women largely, our attitudes towards private wealth, all of this is classicism, and it had been dead 1,200 years before these Italians latched onto it, and dusted it off, and set it up. Modernism, in its broadest context, whatever that means, is the first movement to come along to be able to in any way challenge classicism. The art movements and literary movements that preceded modernism were simply aspects of classicism, Romanticism, Mannerism, the Baroque, all of these are like facets of the classic object. It's only in modernism, and what modernism represents, in my humble opinion, is a kind of return to the archaic. Modernism deconstructs the clarity of the Western eye. If you have to date where modernism begins, it begins with Impressionism, which takes the clarity of the Western eye and begins to dissolve it, and the linear, the columns and lines, that's how narrative was until James Joyce and Henry James and people like that showed that narrative could be broken up. Modernism is a form of primitivism, strangely enough. The people who created modernism, people like Marcel Duchamp and Picasso and the Surrealists, they were tremendously influenced, in the case of Picasso, by African art, masks and sculpture, stuff that had never been seen in Paris in 1905 through 15, and everybody was tremendously excited by it. Modernism is part of this much larger phenomenon, which I call the archaic revival. The discovery of the unconscious through Freud and Jung, the deconstruction of the image, first the image seen through Impressionism, and then the image imagined as deconstructed through Surrealism and Dada, and then finally, you know, the concentration on the materials of art, which you get in Abstract Expressionism, where it is about paint. It's no longer about paint in the service of the visual pictorialism, and then all the post-modern stuff, which is, of course, just sort of running naked, screaming through the street kind of aesthetic. Yes? Well, this thing, only this one instance I mentioned, the scandal of 415, and this guy Alcibiades, and he was fined. He was fined and given a warning. Question, yes? Yeah, the origin, good question. See, what happened? I mean, it's very interesting. Some of you who are interested in Heidegger may know a wonderful essay by Hans Jonas called The Gnostic Temperament, and what he's saying in there is that the attitude, the psychology, of the late Roman Empire, let's say Rome from AD 150 to 400 or so, was strikingly what we would call modern. A profound kind of exhaustion entered into the Roman psychology in that late phase. The good definition of decadence is it's sophistication without feeling. It's Camille Paglia's definition, by the way. And the Roman Empire made the emperor a god. Well, imagine the cynicism that would pervade our society if you were under state order to light candles to George Bush. I mean, you know, we're free to think of the man as a jackass, and it's not heresy. I mean, it may be bad taste, but it isn't heresy. And the Roman Empire expanded so rapidly and took in so many different kinds of people. I mean, there were, you know, the Jews at the end of the Mediterranean, the Parthian Empire had been partially incorporated into the Roman Empire, Egyptian mystery religions and African folk religion, barbarian Celtic ideals were being imported in, and it just became, and the state religion, the religion of the emperor as god, it was fairly tolerant. You had to burn a candle to Caesar, but you could also burn a candle to Sartaeus and Thoth and Hermes and all these other people. What got the Christians in trouble was they wouldn't give Caesar his due, even though it says to do this. You know, they kept claiming that they had some kind of political agenda. They kept expecting the return of a political figure. The Romans hated that because they saw it as a political force. Well, in that situation then, after, you see, you have to talk about early Christianity to get this stuff in context. People don't understand how shaped our knowledge of the origins of Christianity are, with good reason, because the religion wants you to believe that it's all very cut and dried. There are real mysteries surrounding the birth of Christianity. Let me just run through it a little bit. We all know, or most of us know if you're not completely secular, the Christmas story, and it begins, and Caesar Augustus decreed that a census should be taken of all the world, and each was going to his village to register. Do you all know this story? And so this explains why a pregnant Galilean woman, nine months pregnant, is 110 miles away from her home village in Jerusalem. We're told that they are obeying the dictates of Caesar Augustus to participate in the census of the empire, and we're told that Pontius Pilate was procurator of Judea at this time. There was no census ordered by Caesar Augustus. No record exists of this anywhere, and if this had happened, it would have been an enormous bureaucratic task involving hundreds of clerks and the coordination of data from all parts of the empire. It would have been a schtick of some sort, and there's nothing, nothing, only this reference in the story of Christ. Well, you know, weird. Okay, so then you move on. The assumption is that Christ was born in 6 B.C. under the Conjunctio Maximus of Jupiter and Saturn. That places, if you believe the Gospels, that he was killed at age 33. That means the crucifixion must have been in 27. Well, there is no reference to Christ outside the Gospels until A.D. 71. What was happening between 27 and 71? It's damn near 50 years, and the whole thing falls silent. And then what we get in A.D. 71 in, I think, the Roman, I guess it was in Suetonius. Suetonius, who was a Roman historian and contemporary, he says in a long rap about something else, he says Jews have recently come to Rome and caused public disturbances at the behest of their leader, Crispus. This is as close as we get. We don't even know if Crispus is Christ. We just accept that this must be so because Suetonius is telling us that Jews of a religious type have come to Rome and caused this agitation. Some people have even wanted to, that Christianity was invented in the late 60s, and that there never was a person named Christ, that the Zealots who were preparing the uprising of 69 against the Roman Empire created a mythical figure of a generation earlier and used this mythical figure as a symbol of their rebellion. It would be sort of as if we were to get into Joe Hill. You all know who Joe Hill is? The engine of socialism is a slipping back. Come on, all you workers, shovel sand on the track. Joe Hill was a martyr to social reform in this country. I believe he was shot by a firing squad in Utah in 1913. We could reach back to Joe Hill and make him the founder of our movement and say what a great guy he was and collect stories about his life, and we could use it to center ourselves and build a kind of social reform movement in the name of Joe Hill.

Yeah. The sacred mushroom on the cross. He basically says something very much like this. I don't know about that. I just think it's very peculiar that we know so little about Christ when he had such a major role to play. I mean, take a guy like Mani. Mani, the founder of Manism, who was born in, I think, around 320. God, we know everything about Mani. We have his tax returns. I kid you not. We have the guy's tax returns. And we know what he looked like. We know who his friends were. We know he had marital problems. A real person, you know? And yet his religion was stomped into oblivion. So there's something funny about all this. And, of course, Christ is no ordinary person. Christ is the third person of the Trinity, God incarnate. This is a claim, this was an idea that had been around for a few hundred years. You all have heard of Dionysus, who most people tend to connect to Bacchus, the drunken, late Roman god of wine. But the early Dionysus is a much, much weirder figure. The early Dionysus is an androgyne, always in the company of women, a god of ecstatic frenzy. And what the enemies of the Dionysian religion always claimed was, first of all, women were the major followers of Dionysus. And they would intoxicate themselves in some way, and then holding hands down through the countryside and rend their clothing and just carry on outrageously. And what the enemies of the Dionysian religion claimed was that they became so frenzied that these women, who were called Menaeans, ate their own children. This was the lie spread about the Dionysian religion. Well, the story of the birth of Dionysus is very interesting, because his father was Zeus, the hidden higher-all father, analogous to God the Father in Christianity. But his mother was Simila, and in some versions Simila is a mortal woman, the daughter of King Cadmus of Thebes. But in other versions she's herself some kind of a goddess. Anyway, she was one of these many affairs that Zeus had. He was always impregnating women and bearing children. And in the eighth month of her pregnancy, she was struck by lightning and killed, and she was very dear to Zeus. And when he came upon her dead, he immediately performed a caesarean operation, and he cut open his thigh, and he put the child into his own thigh and laced up the wound. And the child was born out of the wound six weeks later. Now, this may be grotesque and peculiar, but notice that what we have here is something close to a virgin birth. It's born of the father is what we have, and Dionysus was then called the twice-born god, because he was born once by caesarean section from his mother, and born again six weeks later from the thigh of the father. And it's thought that this Dionysian impulse in the hands of these mystical Jews became then the doctrine of the immaculate conception, and the whole notion of an immaculately conceived child. Christ is a type of Dionysius. I mean, it's heresy to say so, but comparative religionists have been saying this for centuries. Dionysius was a religion of orgy and ecstasy typical of this period in Greece. Another religious system that was sort of complementing the Hermetica and developing alongside it was Gnosticism. And, you know, I said a few minutes ago that the psychology of the late Roman Empire was very modern. Gnosticism is a very, very modern impulse. It may not at first appear so, because ancient Gnosticism is inflated with angels, demons, what we would call superstition. But if you strip away all that Baroque stuff, you come to a philosophy very similar to the philosophy that many of us have accepted really without thinking. We just call it modern attitudes. But the idea in Gnosticism is that you're on your own, you know. There ain't no free lunch. If God did make the universe, he disappeared shortly afterwards and has no interest in you, your faith, your fears, your hope. We don't belong. Gnostics were profoundly phobic of the world, and they were either very ascetic cults or they were very libertine-like cults, springing from the same idea, which was that they did not belong in this universe. They were from a different place, and their whole concern was to escape. They are the ones who decided that the earth is an iron prison. They didn't like to have children because they felt that to have a child is to trap light in matter. In many Gnostic sects, the only forms of sexual activity that they approved of were forms that were guaranteed to not lead to conception. So oral sex, anal sex, whatever, but never sex which could lead to conception because that would trap the light, and that was an abomination. Needless to say, these sects died out in a hurry because they were self-limiting. There were all kinds of religious impulses, yeah. Yes, he said that these zealots were using Amanita Muscaria as a sacrament and that Christ was a symbol of the mushroom so that they could refer to the mushroom without directly referring to it so that only the believers would know. John Allegra's case is interesting but not entirely persuasive. There needs to be more work in this area. There is something going on in the ancient Middle East about mushrooms. It's hard to reconstruct, first of all, because the climate itself has changed so much that there are no mushrooms. But the evidence is pretty strong and getting stronger that there was mushroom use. I reproduced in my book a picture of a mushroom object, and I was hoping I had another one here, but I guess I left it back at the apartment. Mandaeanism, which is an old, old cult in that part of the world, forbids the use of mushrooms, which is puzzling because there are none. They don't forbid much, but they go way out of their way to forbid mushrooms. Out of all this turmoil, it was very much like modern times. The whole Hellenistic world was awash in religious speculation. On every street corner, they were casting horoscopes and prescribing diets. There were the temple prostitutes, so there was a whole hedonic element in sexuality. Orgy was a style in some religious organizations. Out of all of this religious foment, Gnosticism, Hermeticism, Chaldean oracularism, Jewish syncretism, so forth and so on, and Christianity was in there. But it was just one in the crowd, but with sharpened elbows and a sense of organization, it was able to slowly worm its way into a position of dominance. The real Christians, whatever that means, probably were stamped out under the name of pagans. What happened was, the message of Christianity was that the end of the world was imminent. This is the other thing that they were into that has also reemerged in modern times, is the imminence of the end of the world. For about 180 years after Christ, or 150 years, everybody was so stoned out on this rap that no serious organization got done. They just waited for the end of the world in little communities, practicing voluntary poverty and doing their thing. Then it began to slowly dawn on people that it had been a long time since the Messiah's promise. It was kind of stretching out a little.

And so then certain mentalities in that situation said, you know, this, you know, return of the Messiah is all very well, but I think we should get some real estate under our control and begin a vigorous building program and maybe found some schools and stuff like that. So these religions began to become, to turn away from their end-of-the-world ecstatic millenarianism and to see themselves as organizing for the long haul. And it was in this atmosphere that the Hermetic books were produced and written down. The chief magical ritual of Hermeticism is the invocation, the ability to call stellar demons down into statues, and then these statues prophesy. And this is why Christianity, it takes the Jewish aversion to idol worship and just raises it to a whole new level of intensity, because they were freaked out by this animating of statues with stellar demons thing that the Hermeticists were into. Yeah? Well, this is a good question, you know, I mean, when you're reading a 1,500-year-old account of a magical invocation, if we are to believe them, what happened was by singing certain songs, burning certain incense, and performing these rituals at certain times that were astrologically correct, they could cause these things called decans, which are zodiacal demons of some sort. There are three decans to each zodiacal sign. See, modern astrology has completely, largely forgotten this. I mean, there are people who do decanic astrology, but you have to pay through the nose, because of course this is a lost and dying art. But they would somehow be able to draw these decans down into the statue, and then they could extract knowledge from the statue. And you know, this would lay the basis for these sympathetic magics, which were then later developed in the Renaissance. They're quite powerful, actually. This is why this book I recommended is so interesting, the one on spiritual and demonic magic by Walker, because it shows you how by living a certain life, you know, these Renaissance princes were incredibly wealthy, so you have a suite of apartments which overlook, you know, the plaza San Marco in Venice, and certain colors are prescribed that the walls be painted. You only wear certain kinds of robes made of certain materials. You perform your magical invocations at certain times of day, burning certain incenses. They were big on fresh air and light. It isn't the dark image of magic that we get of, you know, the stirring cauldron and the bat-faced familiar and all that. No, it's all about open air, light, wind blowing through, flowing silk robes. They were angelic magicians, is what they were, and they were evoking these things through the use of sigils, which are magical symbols, and then there became stress on magical alphabets. Enochian is one of these magical alphabets, or languages, rather. John Dee, remember I mentioned the whole 10-year episode with the show stone. Well, one of the subjects which these entities that Dee and Kelly were dealing with returned to again and again and again were the Enochian, this language which they said was the true language that Abraham used to communicate with the angels, and it has a special alphabet, an alien alphabet, and there's even been published an Enochian dictionary of some 4,000 or 5,000 words. There was a very bizarre, this is just a footnote, but a very bizarre episode in the mid-1950s. There was a woman who was a kind of clairvoyant, and she was in contact with flying saucers. I mean, now everybody and their dog is in contact with flying saucers, but at that time it was fairly rare, rare enough that she became an object of interest to the CIA, and at one point she was in the CIA building in Langley, Virginia, and they were interviewing her, and she said, well, there's a flying saucer right outside the window, and these guys rushed to the window and looked, and there was some kind of thing in the sky, and she said, it's giving me a message for you for this colonel, and the message was, Afa, Afa, Afa, A-F-F-A. So he wrote this down. Well, then, I didn't read this, I looked it up, I had to hunch, Afa is the Enochian word for nothingness, just more weirdness. Angelic languages, you know, why do these DMT creatures, why are they so concerned with language, not only language, but alphabets? I had a very weird, in fact, you know, one of the high water weirdness events of my life was when I was young, I used to, I wanted the DMT flash to last longer, so I used to smoke it at the height of LSD trips, and one Christmas vacation, this rooming house that I managed in Berkeley, everybody had gone home for Christmas, I thought, and so I decided I would take some LSD and smoke DMT, and so I took the LSD and I smoked the DMT, it was just nuts, I mean, it's nuts enough, but this was like turbocharged nuts, it went on and on and on, and finally I, there was a woman who I rented a room to upstairs named Rosemary who was supposed to be in Minnesota, and she was an actress and very projective and did everything with great flair, and she apparently came back early from Christmas vacation, so she hit the front steps running of this house and used her key to let herself into the front door and came right around to my door and started beating on my door, well, I am by nature a very paranoid person, I mean, I can be up the Rio Yagwes Yasu in the middle of the Amazon basin, and if I'm out in the rainforest smoking a joint and a stick is broken anywhere near me, I immediately hide, you know, I'm very paranoid, so this woman lets herself in and comes and beats with her clenched fist on my bedroom door, well, I like underwent a coronary thrombosis or something, and I was in the elf space and they were screeching and chattering and showing me all this stuff, and when she did this, I like, I flew off, I jumped, I took two feet in the air and landed on my feet, and it was as though, and don't try this at home folks, it was as though this sudden flash of adrenaline and this sudden movement that I made broke up the ordinary division between the trip and normality or something, anyway, I pulled the trip with me into the room, I was now standing in the room, eyes open, but the elf creatures had come with me, and everything had just been like jacked up to some immense level of intensity, and there were these rotating geometric things in the room hanging in the air, and it was like moving in this jerky motion, this thing was going click, click, click, and it was faceted, and every time it would make this large metallic click, these plastic triangle-shaped brightly colored chips or something, like little pieces of floor tile or something, would fly across the room, and each one of them had a letter on it in an alien language, sort of like Hebrew or Sanskrit, There were several of these machines, and these things were ricocheting off the walls, and I had an elf hanging off each hand, and I was turning her, and I was just saying, holy shit, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm, and then she's still beating on the door, you know. So I stagger over to the door, fling it back, and look at her and say something like, And then she realized at that point what my problem was, and, and retreated. But I, I've never forgotten, it's the one time that, that they went literary on me, and not only did I see them, not only did I hear them, but I, they were printing on the air the message as well. Very curious. I mean, we don't yell. Yeah. I don't know, the first, the first few times I smoked DMT, I had almost no ability to say anything about it at all. I remember the first time I did it, I've never actually seen it hit anybody quite as hard as it hit me the first time. I came out of it, and I said, I can't believe it. I can't believe it. I don't believe it. And I said this about 200 times, because I just, my life, I was blown out of the water. I spent years getting my act together and becoming a Marxist and a this and a that, and had all this stuff all figured out, you know. And it just left me absolutely intellectually naked. It was that everything you know is wrong experience, except that it was from the toes, you know. I mean, everything I knew was wrong. I've never forgotten it. I mean, it is the most, I don't know, it's like hitting the reset button on your whole cosmogonic myth. I mean, you just, it's the convincer. You know, you occasionally meet people who say, you people who take drugs. Listen, you think I believe that this is anything more than you just hyping yourself up on this. I say, listen, you've got 10 minutes to put into exploring that point of view. Check this out, because it's confounding. I mean, people sometimes ask me, is it dangerous? It is if you fear death by astonishment. Astonishment is something we rarely experience as the genuine article. We fake it. Oh, you've really surprised me. But hey, surprise, surprise, it can really get wrathy. You mentioned this thing called, for that did you say it was the most religious? What was that religion? Why is it? Mandaeanism? Well, Mandaeanism is a very old religion. It arose around Jerusalem a couple of centuries before Christ. It was a baptismal cult. And I'm really into the Mandaeans, actually. They were the oldest continuous Western religion in the world with a Gnostic intent. And probably they started out as Jews, but they were persecuted. They claimed John the Baptist as one of their own, and he was a member of some kind of baptismal cult, because we know he baptized Christ. But they were driven out of the area around Jerusalem, and then for centuries they were in Lebanon, and then they slowly made their way across Persia, and they ended up in the swamps of Iraq and Iran. Do you? Is he from Basra? Is he from Basra, that city in the south? It's a very... How do you know? I heard about that religion. People in London told me that they had seen it. Oh, no, they don't like them. Well, Mandaeans, they're very, very interesting. Yes, they have their own religion. Yes, they have their own written language, although in 1847 there was a cholera epidemic that wiped out 90% of the priesthood, and only priests were allowed to learn to read and write this language. I have some facsimile manuscripts from the Vatican Library. I sort of think that we all should become Mandaeans, that of all the religions I've ever looked at and studied, it seems to me the most psychedelic, the most sort of ethically correct. And it would be a great religion to practice on a world scale because they're into caring for the land. They're river nuts. They love rivers, and they build a cult hut called a Mandae, and they always divert a little ditch through it, and then they do their ritual baptisms and stuff like that there. But their folktales and their religious beliefs are very interesting. It's like a religion of biology. The pious god in Mandaeanism is called Hibilzaiwa, and Hibilzaiwa is always referred to as they. So it's that they are in charge, and it's beautiful scriptural stuff. They're very much like Orthodox Jews, only more so in that if you're a religious Mandaean, your life is ruled by all kinds of things, sort of like the rules of kosher. The most difficult rule that these people are asked to keep in their own lives is that if you're really a devout Mandaean, you are considered polluted if your eye falls on an unbeliever, and an unbeliever is a non-Mandaean. So you can imagine how difficult it is when you're down to 400 or 500 people to make sure that's the only people you ever see. The only profession that a Mandaean man can follow and not require ritual decontamination every day is silversmithing. So if you ever go to Baghdad, it's not likely to sin, but if you ever go to Baghdad or Basra or Kirkuk, there are communities of these people, and you find them by going to the silver markets, and then through discreet inquiry you can find them. Well, in folklore, as folkloric anthropologists have developed all these rules, if a religion makes something taboo, you can usually bet that that means they were into it at some point. Because when a religion makes something taboo, it means that there has been a reformist upheaval inside the religion. This is probably how Soma was lost to the ancient Hindus, you know. It's how Zoroaster was called the great reformer. And he was the great reformer because he suppressed a lot of indigenous shamanic cults. And some people think that he actually attempted to suppress Haoma. And Haoma is the Avestan counterpart of Soma. If any of you are interested in all this, this book by Flattery and Schwartz called what is it called? Haoma and Harmaline in Iranian Religion. It's from the University of California Press. And they make a very strong case that Soma was not mushrooms, that it was Pagaman Harmala. And it's really a great, it's a really interesting book. I mean, I learned things that I didn't know. For instance, in the pre-Zoroastrian phase of Iranian religion, drugs were not only used to access the spiritual world, but they actually said there was no other way to do it, which is sort of my position. So it was nice to know that these pre-Zoroastrian Iranian light religions, they were into what they called the Minnag, M-E-N-O-G, the Minnag, and it's another dimension. And you can only attain knowledge of it through the use of drugs. But the Minnag existence is where the dead people are. And what their religion was about was you get to know your own soul through using drugs. And you approach the, it's like a, it's like visiting somebody in stir. You go and your soul comes and meets you, comes through the Minnag existence and meets you at the membrane. And the idea is that during life, you must learn to recognize your soul, because after death, if you can't pick it out of the soul swarm, then you will be somehow incompleted in the after death world. Yeah. To a chicane death by astonishment. Well, DMT raises the possibility of death by astonishment. I was talking to somebody about it last night and I was saying, you know, when you take DMT, the question is not, will I be all right? The question is, have I lived through it or not? Because you can't tell whether you've lived through it or not. DMT is this very short acting hallucinogen that you smoke, but it's a neurotransmitter. It occurs in all human beings on the match and it occurs in various plants and animals in terms of nature. It's the commonest of all hallucinogens in terms of impact. It's the strongest of all hallucinogens. I mean, it's a completely reality obliterating experience and it comes on so quickly that you don't grok it like a drug. I mean, we all know what a drug is. You know, you feel this, you feel that. It gets stronger. It makes you rest finally. It overwhelms you. This isn't like that. This is like that, you know, you and your friends are somewhere and there's talk about this drug and the pipe gets filled and this and that. And then you're about to smoke this drug or maybe you just smoked it. But anyway, a 747 crashes into your apartment building and three times the speed of sound and interrupts whatever you were doing. And sometimes people come out of it saying, you know, what happened? What happened for crying out loud? Nothing happened. You just did it. You mean that's it? Say, yeah, that's what it does. Because it is not. It's more like it happens so quickly that we interpret it as an event coming from the outside rather than a chemical compound diffusing through your body because it completely replaces reality, not with the contents of your unconscious or your unfulfilled dream, wishes or anything, but with another dimension, a space filled with entities busy about their many tasks. Although they notice you and come flocking over with a piercing screech and begin to they like to treat with you, they play with you. They're not entirely friendly. It's sort of like I don't know. It's the kind of feeling I used to have in India when I would go to make these hash buys in these Indian markets. And these guys would say, you know, welcome, welcome. You are my friend. I'm not like all the others. And what it was was, you know, we were there to do business and so it was fine and everything usually went smoothly. But this was no environment into which to let your guard down or anything like that. You've had your hand. We don't know. Nobody knows what it's doing there. And as long as the government makes it impossible for science to pursue rational questions or rational answers to these kinds of questions, it's not likely we'll ever find out. The best guess so far is that it mediates attention, that, for instance, if there were to be a noise over here or movement and I turn and I that that's a little spike of DMT makes that possible, it's where you suddenly narrow your awareness and project it deeply into a small, confined area. This was the best guess of the people who did work on it a few years ago. Yeah. Well, there are a number of physioactive tryptamines DMT is not, if it's made right, not a cardioactive tryptamine. Sometimes when you smoke it, your heart races, but you can't tell whether that's sloppy synthesis or that you're scared. You know, it's made from tryptophan, which is an amino acid, one of the eight essential amino acids, and it's an easy conversion out of tryptophan. Well, it can come from a plant, but if you were to ask a chemist to make it for you, he'd ask you to get him a few hundred grams of tryptophan. Well, on mushrooms, you hear a voice. You don't rarely, at least in my experience, do you see who's talking, but on DMT, all barriers are transcended in the first 30 seconds. I mean, you hear it, you see it, and sometimes you feel it. You know, these little entities, these self-dribbling basketballs, these things that I call the tykes, they jump into your chest, they jump into your chest, and then they jump out again. I don't know why they do that. In the Amazon, among the tribes that use DMT derived from plants, they say, they call these spirit things, they call them hikuli, and they say that you're supposed to not, that they will jump into your chest, and then you're supposed to have a technique to keep them from getting out. And the number of these things that you trap inside your body cavity means, indicates how powerful a shaman you are. Your magic is done through the hikulis that are trapped inside of you. You do, but it's fleeting. It's like, you know, it's different. With DMT, it is more real than this experience of sitting in this room is real. I mean, it is confounding. It's very hard on DMT to tell yourself, this is a drug. I mean, good Lord, it doesn't seem like it. It seems like you just tunneled through an energy barrier into the beta sub X dimension, which is all the time all around us, but somehow you just became virtual and moved across the energy barrier, and there you are, you know? And the other thing about DMT that's weird is it does not affect your mind. In other words, you don't feel gaga with ecstasy. You don't feel relaxed. You feel exactly the way you felt before you did it. It's that the world has just been swapped out. And that's strange. I sort of like that, that it doesn't lay a glove on the observing cognitive processes. Instead, it just does something in the visual cortex that causes the world to be replaced by a three, four, five dimensional, highly colored, moving environment filled with screaming alpha demons. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. No. More like 50 milligrams. We need to go to lunch. This is the last clip. Okay. The question is, can you extend the life of a DMT flash if you pre-dose yourself with MAO? The answer is, probably. This is really a don't-try-this-at-home-folks maneuver, unless you really know your MAO inhibitors. There are MAO inhibitors, synthetics, that will inhibit every molecule of MAO in your body for up to six weeks after a single exposure. This you don't need. An excellent MAO inhibitor for these purposes would be harmine or harmaline, which is reversible in four to six hours. So if you take harmine and pre-dose it, but before you go extending your DMT trip with an MAO inhibitor, you better have just an ordinary, old-fashioned, regular DMT trip and decide whether you really want to spend more time in that. Because, see, the hook is, especially for smart-ass, straight types, is that you say, look, it only lasts ten minutes, for crying out loud. You want to have all these opinions on this subject, but you're not willing to invest ten minutes. So most people, certainly I, I said, I have taken LSD and all that stuff. Ten minutes, bring it on. We'll go out and have a beer afterwards. Well, it turns out that in a holographic universe, ten minutes is indistinguishable from 50,000 years under the proper conditions, so. We'll meet back here at two-thirty. Okay. Well, there seemed to be a lot of hands up when we left. Can anybody pick up the thread? Yeah. I'm a young person. I've been trying to do self-transformation for a long time. And what, what I, I, I recognize very much this, this, this, this. You know, it's a very, you know, it's a very, very, something like, something like this. One of your descriptions of these entities, which I have not encountered, so far, was a higher, a fairly, an image of an elemental spirit, as we would call it in Western, sort of a folk mythology. And why is it? Because you can work it out. You want to know what these other people look like. So, it's very high. It's not going to work out as such. The sense of a small entity, which we know how to work, that is neither good nor bad, that is sort of mischievous, that is not demonic, that is not, you know, an angel, and the sort of sense of being small and being out of work comes to me very much as sort of the impression of an elemental. And one, if you could just respond to that, and also, to me, you've got to think of your own particular racial heritage, and the fact that the main elemental spirits that we think of are Celtic. And whether, how do you sort of, whether you thought of this in a way, but how do you sort of integrate these things? Well, some of you may know this book, it's a classic, called The Fairy Faith in Celtic Countries, by Evans Vance, and it was reprinted recently, and I wrote the introduction to it. It's an, it mentions in there, when Patrick arrived as a missionary in Ireland to convert the pagan Irish, the problem that he encountered was this belief in the land of fairies. And he, in order to convert the pagan Irish, he convinced them that these were souls of the dead in an intermediate zone that was neither heaven nor hell, which he called purgatory. Purgatory was invented to accommodate the folk beliefs of the pagan Irish, and when it was brought back to Rome, it seemed like such a good idea for converting all kinds of pagan peoples on the fringe of the expanding sphere of Christianity, that it's been in place ever since. I've wondered, I think I even talked sometime this week to somebody, about the way in which there seemed to be, there's a kind of a racial or a genetic undertone about some of this stuff. I never really felt, I didn't know until I was 13 years old that I wasn't a white person, because I grew up in Colorado where everything was white bread culture, and my father may have had opinions about the IRA and all that, but we were never told that we were Irish. And some of you who have roots in this city know that as recently as 50 years ago, they used to have signs up along 8th Avenue that said, no dogs or Irish allowed. So I reconnected to that part of the heritage. The Irish are stereotypically known to be susceptible to intoxication, to be great word spinners, and to have this peculiar relationship to fairyland or something. I don't want to think that I'm just exploring the Celtic collective unconscious. It seems to me these things must be there for everybody. Nevertheless, we're so concerned to suppress racial differences, because we're a democracy, and because racial problems have haunted American politics from the very beginning, that we tend to want to believe that everybody is the same. But in fact, I took a course once at Cal, which was interesting, it was given by the forensics department, the only course I ever took in the forensics department, and it was called Biochemical Markers for Individuality. And one of the things we did, it was actually taught by Alexander Shogan, the great drug designer, and one of the things we did is he brought in a little vial of some kind of chemical and he passed it around, and out of 200 people in the class, 198 couldn't smell it at all, and two people were so overwhelmed by the smell of this that they actually became physically sick for a few minutes. Well what this is, and then he explained to us, these people were probably up to 50,000 times more sensitive to this chemical than most people, and that this is a gene that you carry for sensitivity to this thing. Those kinds of compounds, aromatic compounds, compounds with an electronically active ring structure, are the very nearest relatives to drugs, and so it's reasonable to suppose that there are genetic differences in the way we relate to drugs, which doesn't mean racial differences, it means from person to person. But it also may mean that what a race is, is a collection of related genes that are more frequently found together than not. This is why, technically speaking, you can never say so-and-so belongs to a race, because a race is a quality of a group, it's not something an individual is. You have to have a bunch of people before you can say that you're confronting a phenomenon of race. So it may be that what Aboriginal people believe is that there are shamanic lines, family lines, there's a greater susceptibility to these things than others. So one of the things you learn when you begin to explore psychedelic substances is that it isn't hitting everybody the same way. In fact, it can hit people radically different ways. Society misrepresents drugs tremendously. For example, we all know the stereotype image of the pothead. Now, the pothead can't work, can't remember, it's the inarticulate dumb hippie image. Well, I've never met anyone with a deeper devotion to cannabis than myself. And, you know, I'm very proud of my memory and my ability to get verbally organized under almost any condition. So, I completely violate the stereotype of what it is to be a pothead. How many people are there like that? I mean, I'm always amazed when people say, you know, no, I don't want to smoke any pot or mess with my memory. I mean, really? How peculiar. So, what you have to do is, just like every other thing, everything you've been told is wrong, and you have to take life by the handlebars and figure out what's really going on. Which doesn't mean that you're reckless. I mean, there are bad drugs, there are bad politics, there are bad relationships. I hope that answered your question. It was a two-part question, wasn't it? Well, it's so easy that you can't be part of anything unless you're just sort of an elemental spirit. So what do you think that's possible in relation to? Well, when you say they're like elemental spirits, is that because you spend a lot of time with elemental spirits? Well, I thought spirits were sort of... It's true, they are. I mean, they are... They don't look like them, though. They don't look like anything. There was a really bad movie. Those of you who don't have kids can tune out here, but since I have kids, I've seen a lot of bad movies because that's what they make for kids. And I think it was four or five years ago at Christmas time, there was this movie called Santa Claus. Just tune out on it. But there was one scene in the elves' workshop where they were making thousands of toys and there were all these conveyor belts going from level to level and these guys rushing around at full speed with the most D.M.T.-like reconstruction I've ever seen. So it's funny, though, that the elf mythology doesn't carry the sense of strangeness that you get in the D.M.T. flash, although I suspect that what that is is that we've been polluted by Disney, that Disney has given us this vision of fairies that were too harmless. The Tinkerbell phenomenon. Because if you go back before, is it Andrew Lang who wrote all those books, the Blue Fairy Book, the Brown Fairy Book, the White Fairy Book? Those are weird, those stories. I mean, fairies are weird. They steal babies. That's their main way of relating to human beings is they steal human infants and leave behind wizened, deformed, sickly creatures who become very strange and peripheral kinds of human beings. And fairies, if you get trapped in fairyland, the only way out is through, they're language-oriented. They will never do you damage if you can convince them that you're a master of words. It's poetry that they like. And all over the world there is this persistent motif of these small entities. Well, I'm not suggesting that they're really there, but I don't know what's going on. I think it's odd that they should persist and that they should be experientially available. I mean, you have to understand, a different person saying this to you, it would be a whole different thing if it was Madame so-and-so and so forth and so on. I'm pushed to this stuff by experience because my inclination is toward reason. It's just that everybody moves along safe channels. Everybody stays out of the fast lane. And if you move to the edges, and drugs are certainly an edge, and a full exploration of one's sexuality is certainly an edge, and going off to weird corners of the world and staying long periods of time is certainly another edge. And if you do these kinds of things, a whole affirming world of white-bred, European, bourgeois, work-hard types just looks as weird as any cultural adaptation could possibly be. I mean, I have said many times, and you probably agree to some degree, that reality is created by language. But we don't realize how true this is, that reality really is created by language, and that we are all imprisoned in somebody else's language. This isn't how we want to talk. I think 90% of the words and constructions we use would be great-grandfather. We are living inside a 90% 19th century worldview, and culture cannot evolve any faster than its language evolves, because what cannot be said cannot be done. What cannot be said cannot be put in place. So in a way, one way of thinking about psychedelics is that they empower language. It's a way to force the evolution of language. The way you stretch the envelope of culture is by creating language. Everybody, I mean, this happens. Constantly in society, you know, Hasidic Jews or reggae people or whatever, the way they create their boundaries is through language, you know? The Catholic Church, this is how they do it. Speaking Yiddish is a way to do it. You create a new reality inside the old one, and you can do it by moving backward into a specialized language, or you can move forward into a new language. I mean, look at how the introduction of the computer has transformed our language in the 70s and the 80s. I mean, draw CPU, throughput, output, input, bug, glitch, all of this stuff. These are words that have been empowered by our involvement with a machine. Now, before that, the major influence on language in my lifetime was the LSD episode of the 1960s, and it always amuses me how much time and energy the establishment spends on heaping abuse on hippie talk. And even now, it's sold to you guys as West Coast talk. It's sold on the West Coast as L.A. talk. It's sold, here you are, you're close to it, but not of it. It's like they used to say of the Watergate scandal, linked but not painted. And what LSD did, I mean, I can remember, I can remember, if I can remember, words like, or a concept like ego trip. The first time I heard that, I didn't know what it meant. I couldn't even, I didn't have the concept. Well, then once somebody explains to you the concept, then you've got it. Vibes. That notion introduced a whole bunch of people to the idea of emotions. They said, you know, you walk in the room, it was a bad vibe, man. It means that there's no rational deconstruction of what was going on, but you could just tell it was not a place you wanted to be. So it began to empower new realities that were able to emerge. And it was very important, I think, to the establishment to suppress that, because new words are the beginnings of new realities. The gay thing is an interesting example of that. I mean, it goes from what was it called in the 19th century, the love that dare not speak its name. Interesting. See, it was there, but you dare not speak its name. Somehow to name it was to bring it too much into the forefront. And people who were gay, nobody could name anybody, it was worse than being a communist. Now, it's empowered. And all the various racial groups who have had to come up through the American meat grinder have had to create vocabularies of community that they were proud of. Rather than accepting the vocabulary of the dominator culture. A good example is the NAACP. The word colored people is embedded there, and yet these were the sincerest and most radical people in that movement at a certain date to the dominator designation for their subgroup. And constantly oppressed minorities are trying to get the language right. And it's important for us to do this too. I mean, are we stoners? Are we heads? Are we shamans? What are we exactly? Well, pouring psychedelic substances into that mix then opens the doorway for the logos to define you. And building community is part of this. We are an interesting potential community because we tend, unfortunately, toward the lily white, but not cerned. I don't see any class dominating. There are probably people in this room who could buy and sell all the rest of us without going past their small change. There are also probably people who scraped and saved for this weekend and could ill afford it. We don't seem to be embedded in that class structure so much. Maybe we represent a level of education. Maybe we're some kind of generally definable group of people by level of education, but I don't see that either. What holds us together is what holds all subcultures together, which is an experience. In this case, not something else but the experience of being loaded. And it's a very powerful and immediate kind of experience. And I'm sure some of us are more loaded than others, and in any subgroup you'll get that kind of a spectrum. It's always pretty shocking. I've spent a lot of time on it. What happens for me is that these entities want me to do what they're doing. And what they're doing is using sound to make objects appear out of the air. They can sing objects into existence. And this, I think that they're language elves. They're not made of matter. Well, then what are they made of? It seems as though the place you go on DMT is made purely of language. It's as though there is a syntax hard thing to picture. They're like sentences rather than organisms. The essence of their presentation is like that of a pun. And so what they want you to do is they want you to learn to make a better kind of language. They want you not more articulate, not more clearly defined, but they actually believe or suggest that there can be a dimensional breakthrough into a language that is seen with the eyes. I think that the breakthrough that we're waiting for is not going to come out of a political movement or a redistribution of wealth or anything which could be called political. It's going to come out of a shift in the body. And these things happen. I mean, it's very mysterious how it happens. Like, think about language, ordinary language. Here you have two people. One is mute and the other has the ordinary powers of speech. They look exactly alike. You can't tell a mute person from anybody else. And they're really complex behavior. Language is a behavior of some sort. And it's very hard to imagine that it slowly insinuated itself into our being. It looks to me more like it was a kind of quantum leap of some sort and probably appeared very suddenly. And there have been other less dramatic but more recent things like this going on. For example, you know, you go to school and they teach you that in the 15th century, perspective was the thing for me to understand. I mean, perspective was discovered. How could it be discovered? I mean, you just walk. Here it is, right? And say, no, before 1425, people didn't know that the part of the house farther from you was smaller than the part of the house. You can't understand. It doesn't make any kind of sense. Another example is St. Augustine, who was this great father of the church and who was, by the way, African. And he was known as the most brilliant theologian of his age. And the way he would prove to people that he was an exceptional and holy man was they would open a book of theology in front of him and let him look at it for a few minutes, and then they would close the book and he would be able to tell them what was written there. As far as we can tell, St. Augustine was the only man in Europe who could read silently. Can you imagine this? It was a miracle. We don't know how the bugger does it. You just show him the book, and then he can tell you what's written there. Meanwhile, everybody else has to say, Now, we've completely assimilated this, although there are still a few among us who move their lips when they read. Vladimir Novikov used to cruelly sneer at these people. He said once in an interview, he said, for people who move their lips when they read. And a final example, which will indicate that we've come to the end of the line, in terms of sudden behaviors emerging, is according to my friend Bill Gibson in his book, The Different Tension, oral sex was virtually unknown in England until the middle of the 19th century, and then it was brought in by French prostitutes, which is just a mind-boggling concept to these Victorians. They could not wrap their mind around it. Well, you know, from our vantage point, we probably assume people have been into this since the Stone Age. Maybe they have, but at least for several centuries in Victorian England, it absolutely died out as inconceivable. Breakdancing is another one of these, where a behavior suddenly emerges, completely coherent and formed, and then it recedes. Or if it has cultural utility, it's stabilized, such as my previous example. So what these types seem to be trying to say is, there is a way for you to use your voice in order to activate a language which is not culturally taught. It isn't that you learn it from your parents, but that it's in the bone, a poetic language, a language scripted into your genes. And not only is it an erspruch, an original speech, the vehicle of primal poetry, it can be seen. And, you know, it's interesting how, in our culture, when we talk about how somebody is really a gifted speaker, we always reach for visual metaphors. We say, I see what you mean, you know? You know, and in Spanish they say, if they're talking to you and they want to know if you follow, they say, is it clear? Claro? Claro means is it clear? It's a visual metaphor. Say, she paints the picture, or his words have great clarity. What this means is that unconsciously we trust the eyes and we don't trust the ears. Telepathy, which most people I think think of as being able to hear somebody else think, is not that at all. What telepathy is, is when you see what other people mean. Because when you see what somebody means, it's like standing in their shoes. Point of view. That's a very visual point. If you can understand somebody else's point of view, you are that person in that moment for that purpose. And I think that it's amazing that the world has evolved as far and as fast as it has the human world, glued together by nothing more than small mouth noises. I mean, that's what we're talking here, small mouth noises. As monkeys, we're set up for this. I mean, you can talk longer than just about any other activity that you can do without becoming exhausted. I mean, I'm the living proof of it. A very small amount of energy is required to keep the old tongue and lips going with the air and moving out. I mean, imagine if we had to communicate, as deaf people do, with sign language all the time. This is exhausting. I mean, nobody communicates like that for four or five hours at a stretch, and yet Castro can give a four-hour speech at the drop of a hat. So we're set up for this. The problem is it requires a congruence of interior dictionaries, because what happens is my words go across space as an acoustical signal. They enter your ear. You are very rapidly looking up each word as it comes in and comparing it to your definition. And as long as we don't look too closely at this, communication seems to be happening. The biggest showstopper there is in most situations is to say to somebody, Now, would you explain to me what I just said to you? Because then it turns out, you know, the definitions are wildly variant. I mean, it's not so wild if you're saying, you know, since you're up, would you get me a grant? Although even that's ambiguous. Maybe they say, why don't you just have one grant? But if you get into deep stuff, if you're saying, you know, the ontological modalities of the post-Renaissance mind have issued into a situation of deconstructionist vitality such that all bets are off. Now, would you explain to me what I just said? I can't even do it with myself. I mean, people say, would you repeat what you just said? No chance. So, and I've looked at this, and there are models for this kind of verbal communication. Did we talk yesterday about the octopi and all that? No, thank God. Well, see, whenever you think you're about to take a step that nobody has taken and go a place nobody's ever been, if you look back at Mother Nature, you can usually find that you've been scooped. And a very interesting example of this vis-a-vis language is what's going on with octopi. Octopi and squids, as you may or may not know, but most people know it because they absorb all these TV shows about nature. Somebody once said to me, I know you don't like television, but it's a wonderful way for my children to learn about nature. Anyway, what we've all learned from watching these wonderful shows about nature is that octopi can change colors. And most people think it's because they're into camouflage. You know, you move on to green seaweed, you turn green, brown rocks, you turn brown. It isn't that at all. It's something much more profound. It's that all over the surface of octopi are these specialized cells called chromatophores. And they can change into many colors. And not only can the octopus change colors, but the ordinary, rubbery, smooth surface of the octopus can be made like goose bumps, but more dramatically wrinkled very suddenly. The other thing about an octopus is because they're soft-bodied, when they're in water, which is their natural element, they are very, very adept at folding and unfolding various parts of their body. So they can reveal a part of their body and then fold in and then show another part. And they're like a silk scarf in water. Well, what's going on here is that octopi communicate with each other by the way they look. And at first, this doesn't seem so profound. It just seems interesting. But when you analyze what's happening, you realize that this is a profound evolution in the project of communication because there is no culturally sanctioned dictionary among octopi. And really what is happening is the octopus wears its mind on its surface. They have a vast repertoire of dots, blushes, traveling patterns that move across their surface. And these behavioral displays indicate the internal state of the organism. It is literally, it wears its language on the surface of its skin. It is a syntactical creature. Its behavior is its syntax. And, you know, some of these octopi as a whole, they're mollusks. They're not even vertebrates. I mean, these things split from the line of development that leads to us 700 million years ago. You want to talk about an alien form of life. An octopus is about as far away from the human experience as you can possibly get. They evolved in shallow coastal waters. But then because so many things were evolving in those shallow waters, some of them evolved into the basic depth. And in those depths, there is no light. So in order to preserve their ability to communicate over long periods of time, they evolved phosphorescent chromatophores all over their body. And some octopi even have eyelid-like membranes put on various places of their skin so that they can blink very rapidly and modulate the phosphorescent light. So you can imagine in the darkness of the densic depths of the ocean, the communication between two octopi is just a dance of light in utter darkness. I mean, these are its naked mind in the water. And when they are in communication like that, they are for all practical purposes one organism. This is why octopi excrete ink into the water. It's so that they can have a private moment. Essentially, the octopus ink is the equivalent of correction fluid. You just have to erase it. I didn't mean that at all. And then here's what I really meant. Well, this is why I'm interested in virtual reality, because it seems to me what we're trying to do is some kind of striptease of the mind. We want to get the mind naked, because if it can be made naked, then we will understand each other. We are clothed in flesh, and then clothing, and then class difference, race difference, age difference, income difference. But if you could see the mind naked, the commonality of human beings would be reinforced, and the presence of ego among us would be diminished. Also, there's no ambiguity in visible language. It's interesting that in the book of Revelation, there is this talk about how there is this sword which comes out of the mouth. It's describing a word which can be seen. The whole history of the evolution of the Western mind is, in a sense, the birth of the Logos. The Logos is making its way towards self-expression, and it's doing this by claiming dimension after dimension of manifestation. I think that electronic media, and electronic culture, and drugs, and the mixing of all our world cultures together, what this is empowering is a visible Logos, a Logos that is beheld, and therefore lacks ambiguity. Yes? I have a question. Mind and soul, in my estimation, probably not correctly, tend to migrate toward each other. In the late medieval period, you get a lot of talk about, is the spirit the same thing as the soul, and are these things the same as the intellect? I mean, yes, we are soul, but I would say mind is the visible manifestation of soul. That would be a good Catholic definition, because you see that keeps soul out of animals. If you say mind is the visible manifestation of soul, then you have restricted the existence of soul to the human species. Well, the mind is not a form of intelligence. The mind is the theater in which intelligence is manifested. You don't want to confuse the garage with the car. Well, maybe I sort of hear you associating mind to brain, because you're saying heart and mind. I mean, mind is heart. Everything goes on within the confines of mind. It's like the light that you switch on when you walk into a darkened room, and then everything else is the furniture within the room. Mind is simply the light which is shed over the landscape of appearances. I mean, this is only my definition. I'm aware of the Neoplatonic emphasis on the mind. I think they called it the ends, and so forth and so on. But in modern psychological terms, the mind is just the theater of cognition in some way. Mind, consciousness. No, consciousness is something which happens in the mind. I mean, there is an unconscious mind as well. Mind is the inclusive category, I think. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Yeah, I think that's very good. The hardest thing to figure out is a mirror, because what a mirror shows you is yourself. But a mirror is not yourself. A mirror is a piece of glass with silver vapor deposited on the back of it. But that's a very different thing from yourself. In this psychic domain, in this psychedelic space, you are not simply perceiving that space. You are creating it with your expectations as well. So if you have strong expectations of a certain sort, that will be the character of the thing. I think we talked about this yesterday, about how here we have peasant A chopping wood in the woods. And suddenly, a ripple of heat passes through the forest. And a hackle raising sense of weirdness. And this guy throws down his axe and looks over his shoulder, and a light is descending from the sky. Now, what happens next, interestingly enough, depends on the year and the place. If the year is, let's say, 1000, and the place is southern France, then the Virgin Mary will be descending from the sky. If the place is Kansas, and the date is 1958, then the space people are descending from the sky. You see, what happens is that when there is cognitive dissonance, good old psychological phrase, when there is cognitive dissonance, the mind rushes forward to provide explanation. I mean, it's amazing. You just walk with people and walk outside, and there's a little light in the sky. It's no big deal, just a moving light. And everybody will say, oh, I wonder if it's a UFO. It means they've got something hiding in the back of their mind. And if anything gets slightly weird, they will rush this explanation forward. And for some people, you know, it's Jesus, and for somebody else, it's Maitreya. So cultural expectations are inextricably woven in to these strange encounter scenarios. There was an interesting UFO theory a few years ago that I thought was kind of cute. I didn't exactly believe it. But these people, Michael Persinger and some Lafrenier, they wrote a really amusing book called Space-Time Transience and Unusual Events. And one of the things they came up with was a long earthquake fault. You get the grinding of enormous masses of rock together, and if these rock masses have a high percentage of quartz in them, you can get what is called piezoelectric phenomenon. Now, piezoelectricity is simply a peculiar form of static electricity. But what it would do is it would create all lightning in the sky, which would follow these stress lines in the earth. And, you know, there is a connection not understood between earthquakes and the appearance of UFOs. But one of the interesting things that Persinger discovered about piezoelectricity is that if you in the laboratory build piezoelectric generators that generate fields of enormous strength, then as a person is exposed to these things, they actually mess with your mind. They actually create people become more and more confused and uneasy and ultimately panic-stricken in the presence of these piezoelectric fields. Well, once you pass the panic moment, then your mind is going to start telling you what's happening. It's going to say, you know, you're having an encounter, something weird is going on. And then out of the unconscious comes the projection, the flying saucer, the Virgin Mary, the elf invasion, the manifestation of Maitreya, whatever it is. So it's that mind goes to meet the unknown, but not without a hell of a lot of baggage of its own, which it immediately tries to unpack and put into the drawers of the other as soon as it arrives. Oh, dear. Too fast and too brilliant for me, too. The mind is not intelligence. It's not the soul. It's sort of the theater in which all these other things take their place. Somebody... Kat and I were in the Amazon in 76, taking Ayahuasca. We got in with this certain group of people in Peru that took it every week. And, you know, cultures have different ways of handling hassle. And in some cultures it's confrontational, in other cultures not. The way these Peruvian country folk operated was if somebody was screwing up, nobody would ever say so. They would just talk about these people behind their back until the morphogenetic field of gossip was so strong that you would basically awaken to the problem. So there was a complex social situation going on in this Ayahuasca circle, which was there was a master shaman who we were apprenticed to, who was beloved by his neighborhood. But he had a nephew, a sobrino, who was a jerk. And this guy was, as Don Fidel said, ambitious. He dealt a little weed, he did a little pimping, he was just sort of an edge-runner type of guy. And every Saturday night we would all get together and take Ayahuasca, about 30 of us. Older shamans, our guy, people from the neighborhood, and this sobrino, Don Jose. So I don't know what the real history of it was, because I had just arrived on the scene, but these old guys would sing these Icaros, these magical songs on Ayahuasca that appear as colored tapestries in front of your eyes. And they had soul, they were into it, and this guy would sing against them. I mean, it's the rudest thing you can possibly imagine. Imagine if Lou Reed were trying to give a performance and the guy in the third row just launched into Old Man River and kept at it. I mean, in this town, I'm sure large guys would appear and say, Sir, how did you do? In Peru it didn't work like that. They just kept singing, he kept singing, and it was clear that this is how it was going to be handled. That we had just divided into two separate entities here. Well, my wife was sitting next to me, and he was sitting across the room from us, the sobrino. And I had been watching him for a long time, and I was loaded to the gills. And I could see he would get up on his haunches, and he looked like a monkey. His face, it was uncanny. I mean, he looked like a monkey, and he also looked kind of like a jackal, a dog with long teeth. He kept going through these changes, and Kat leaned over to me and said something like, This guy is an asshole. And I just said, you know, let it slide. What do we know? Think of it as anthropology. But she wasn't having it. So after a while, he kept doing this. And at one point, everybody in the room, every person in the room was bummed out. And they were looking at their laps. All eye contact was broken. It's actually, when I was a kid, I invented a word. The word is fardow. And it means the embarrassment you feel when someone else fucks up. You know, and you happen to just be there, but somehow the aura of it is so strong. So the entire room is just awash in fardow. And the old guys are singing, and the guy is singing. So then at the end of a particularly intense clash of these two styles, my wife just looked across the room at this guy and, like, put the planning on him. And I saw these red arrows leave her eyes and, like, dotted lines go across her face. And they moved fairly slowly, you know, more slowly than you could throw a ball or something. Well, when this line of red arrows got to this guy, he was knocked off his feet. He fell backwards with his legs in the air, and there was a big noise. And all the singing stopped, and everybody in the room looked up. And these three old shamans who were sitting behind Don Fidel, who I, to that point, had not heard speak any language but Quechua, one turned to the other, and he says in Spanish, Oh, the gringa sent the brrrr. You know, yeah. You mean becoming a jaguar and all that? Yeah, what kind of resort was it to make a jaguar? It's, it's, everything happens. I mean, they used to, when I first went to the Amazon, they used to say to us, the Indians and the folks who helped us haul our stuff around, they would say, la selva como un sueño. It's like a dream. The forest is like a dream. And I thought that that was a poetic metaphor of some sort, you know, like, it's not, it's the, you need to read various people who've written on the boundary between wilderness and settled space. When you go into the jungle, language becomes everything, and unbelievably bizarre things happen, and they really do happen. I've seen this in myself, because when I first went to the Amazon, I knew virtually no botany. I only knew drug botany, because I was so focused on that. We would row down, we would go down these jungle rivers, and there would be powers that would pass, where no, no words related to where I was would come to me. I called it the big green. That's what it was to me. It was the big green, and there was a lot of different kinds of green, and that was it. Well, then the next time I went to the Amazon, I was with professional field botanists, and we would go out into the jungle, and these guys were just like children. You know, they'd say, look at this, this is a polychorea, look at these myrrhoma trees, look at this hyalcyanthus, look at this, look at this, and soon my mind was filled with language about the green, and the green all disappeared, and instead there were plants that I knew and that were familiar to me, and this coming to terms with a local language is very interesting. You see, we, you speak the language you speak in most cases because of where you were born. If you were born in Russia, you speak Russian. China? Chinese. And an interesting thing about these languages is that you really can, they say you can never go home again, but in this rap, you never can leave home. You know, you go to the Amazon, but if you're explaining it to yourself in the language of the East Village, you never leave the East Village. You know, you have somehow carried an envelope of local association with you, and you can never break through it, and so in a way, you never see the place where you are. It's very important to try and make some accommodation to the local language because in a way, only the local language is appropriate to the place. You know, France is a good example. It doesn't make any sense if you don't speak French. Germany makes no sense if you don't speak German. Somehow the local language is a part of the local reality, and we ignore all this and behave as if everything is very straightforward. The one thing you learn taking psychedelics is that nothing is straightforward. Anybody? No, I think there's one transcendental object that exerts attraction wherever it can. You see, evolution, what evolution seeks to do is to stop itself. Every organism wants to evolve into what's called a climaxed ecosystem. That's where everybody has their chair and nobody moves. So there are no empty chairs. You see, everyone has a place to sit, but there are no empty chairs. Where you get evolution is where you have a room half full of empty chairs. Then you have the choice of where to sit. Most animal species and plant species are not evolving, or are evolving very slowly, because evolution tends to dead-end itself. Let me take cockroaches, for example. Cockroaches achieved their present evolutionary status 200 million years ago. They haven't changed an iota. We can dig up fossils from the Pennsylvania coal beds that have cockroaches no different, except slightly larger, than the ones running around in your apartment. So this has been clearly a very successful strategy for cockroaches, if the only thing that matters is the propagation of more cockroaches. Nevertheless, their cultural accomplishments have been dismal. Until recently, I had a friend once who so seriously claimed that 50% of the structural integrity of New York City was contributed by cockroaches between the walls, and if all the cockroaches were to ever march out, the whole thing would just fall down. You see, it's thought by the straightest people in the biz that before human beings, the major force creating evolutionary opportunity were rivers. This happens because the course of rivers will vary over time, and that means that rivers expose and inundate a lot of land. So along rivers, you find what is called, well, I can't remember what it's called, I'll name it. It's called unclaimed territory, sandbars, and large areas where nothing grows. Well, into those kinds of areas, what are called volunteer species or invader species can make their way, and these invader species evolve very rapidly. For instance, in a climax tropical rainforest, what you find are enormous trees and vines, and then the epiphytes and stuff that grow on them. These trees may flower once every 20 years or so, and when they do flower, they often produce a very limited amount of fruit. What you find along rivers and places like that are what we call weeds, and what a weed is is a plant that is, number one, annual. It dies every year, and weeds produce enormous amounts of seeds. A weed strategy is a strategy for the rapid invasion and claiming of empty land, and before human beings, rivers were the major creators of empty land. Carl Sauer, who was a biologist and a geographer, he said, man found the earth, a climaxed rainforest, and we will leave it a weedy lot. What that means is we create so much waste land that these annual, heavy-seeding, rapacious plants are replacing the products of climaxed evolution, which are enormous trees and vines and that sort of thing. Anybody else? This is your last crack. I have a lot of respect for most of his work. I thought that book, The Messengers of Deception, was so off the track that I actually went to a book signing of his and leafleted the crowd with an attack on it. It shows you what a nut I am. For those of you who don't know, Jacques Vallée had a very interesting approach to understanding flying saucers, and I still think this is the best method. His argument meant something like this. He said, it's not productive to ask where the flying saucers come from or what they want. He said the way to understand flying saucers is to analyze their effect. If you can analyze their effect, that's what they're doing. That's what they want to achieve. So what are flying saucers doing? Talk shows. Well, they do talk shows, but what is the effect of them doing all these talk shows? What they are doing is they are causing vast numbers of people to doubt science. If you analyze what the effect, since 1948, of the flying saucers is, they have caused millions of ordinary people to think scientists don't know what they're talking about. That's right, that it offers a new alternative. Now, here's an interesting analogy, and it's not mine, it's Jacques Vallée's. But let's think we've been talking so much today about the late Roman Empire. Here's another take on the late Roman Empire. The Roman Empire was this immensely successful civilization in that it was able to export its vision of an imperial center over vast parts of the world. The problem with the Roman Empire was that it was an ethical disaster. First of all, it ran entirely on the backs of slaves. So anybody who starts talking to you about the grandeur that was Rome should be reminded, the grandeur of Rome was, it was a bargain basement on three floors masquerading as a military brothel. It was not a great civilization. And what happened to Rome? Well, they had all these people inside the empire, among them Jews. And over there in Jerusalem, a long way from Rome, where communication was difficult, this story got loose among the Jews. And from the point of view of the Roman Imperium, the Jews were a barbarian people. They were Semites, and they had some strange religion and so forth and so on. They were looked upon, in other words, as primitives. And so, and if you were to have sat down to have dinner with a typical Roman bureaucrat of the Imperium, you would discover that the table talk would be all about democracy and atomism, Epicureanism, Stoicism, and skepticism. In other words, they were thoroughly modern people, and they thought they had very advanced bullshit detectors. And so then, you know, it comes to the attention of this Roman noble that the house slaves, the kitchen boys, and the gardeners are all whispering and all excited about some Galilean magician who's running around the eastern Mediterranean telling people that not only can he rise from the dead, but so can you. And a Roman sophisticate looking at this would say, you know, these primitive, uneducated, colored people that we have to put up with, you know, why don't these people step out of their own private Idaho and get with the program and study a little Greek philosophy? They're just superstitious. Well, hey, in a world where information moved no faster than a horse could gallop, within a century, these uneducated, superstitious people and their irrational religion of magical redemption were hammering at the gates of Rome. And a century after that, the emperor himself, a god for political purposes, has to make Christianity the official religion of the empire. In other words, what happened was that political and technological and architectural accomplishments got way, way out in front of ethics. And at that point, the unconscious said, I'm going to pull the rug out from under these Roman dominator types. I'm going to unleash a religious system in their very midst that will be an informational virus, that they'll be dead before they ever know what hit them. And this is what Christianity is, you know? I mean, it was a religion of the displaced underclasses of the empire, and within 300 years, it took over and began its own pogroms and genocidal programs of extermination. The flying saucer is a similar thing. We have achieved great things in technology, and in social organization, and in scientific research. But like the late Roman Empire, ethics and morality have lagged far behind. And so now, the same unconscious that sent us the mystery of the virgin birth and the resurrection, which completely confounded Roman rationalism and what were they to make of that, a virgin birth and a resurrection from the dead, they send us the flying saucers. And the flying saucers are destroying the faith in the scientific control systems and managerial theories at the very center of our civilization, just as surely as the Roman Imperium was broken by this superstitious religion. So what it is, is that there is a force in this world, call it the unconscious, call it the cosmic giggle, call it whatever you want. But when a society gets all twisted and out of balance, it can pull it down in a hurry. And I think the psychedelic thing in the 60s was viewed this way. It's that the dominator society is incredibly fragile. I mean, that's why whenever you see somebody who has to pile up guns and guns and guns, it means that they're not terribly confident of their ability to keep control of the scene. We have so many kinds of guns pointed at us, propaganda, social engineering, manipulation of the media, they do it all to us and they still can barely keep ahead of it. They hate the spread of unreason, they hate psychedelic drugs, hell, they don't even like people to work up a sweat on the dance floor. Anything, anything which bespeaks, anything other than lady-like and gentleman-like, parlor-oriented English upper-class behavior completely drives them into a swivet. And yet, you know, they launch a horror upon the world that makes anything the Roman Imperium undertook look like child's play. I mean, the stunts they pulled with the rack, you know, where they could kill, who knows, 100,000, 200,000, they don't even count the dead when they get pissed off. So that's why I think this archaic revival is in full throttle right now. I think the dominator model is doomed, and all the things that are coming forward, you know, the assertiveness of racial minorities, the assertiveness of sexual and intellectual minorities, people are just saying, you know, we're not going to take it anymore. And don't tell us what to believe, and don't tell us what drugs to take, and don't tell us what's politically correct, because your record is a nightmare. And this general discontent spreading through society is, I think, keeping a lot of these dominator types up late at night, trying to figure what's going on. And can you imagine being in charge of the planet as though, you know, suppose you were the CEO of General Motors, or something like that? I mean, every piece of data that crosses your desk says, you know, you're in trouble, big trouble. Somebody had a question. Yeah. You're asking about extraterrestrial civilization. Are you asking that there are barely one kind of extraterrestrial civilization? No, I'm saying they're coming from another dimension of some sort that actually has a plan for the human race that is larger than the plan of the people who seek to run this society. Their plan is a brilliant plan. Their plan is, let's keep everything as much the same as possible. I mean, since World War II, they have been at war with the future. They do not want to let the future happen. And, of course, the future is building up like a log jam in a river. And what it means is when the future finally tears loose and overwhelms these structures that they have built, it's going to be more dramatic, more sudden, more violent than they could ever have dreamed of or imagined. The establishment, yeah. Who are they? No, they're forcing the evolution of language. The real cataclysmic future does not lie in the propagation of the errors of industrial materialism. The real transformation of the future is built into the rocks, the ocean, the animals. It's not coming from human beings. The people who think they're running the world are dreaming. I'm completely convinced that no one is in control and that this is very good news. You know, nobody is in control, not the Communist Party, the Vatican, the World Bank. Nobody is in control. There may be groups who dream of controlling, but their frustration level must be approaching infinity at this point. Yeah, that's right. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. No, no, this was a military event. Alaric the Visigoth and his folks were moving south through the Peloponnesus, and they were burning and destroying everything in their path. I mean, when we say that they burned Eleusis, it was in the act of burning Greece that they burned Eleusis. It was a case of military conquest. See, it wasn't—people think that these barbarians who invaded the Roman Empire were not Christian. Most of them were. They had converted to Christianity long before they breached the frontiers of the Empire. So Alaric the Visigoth and his folks were basically in a position, they burned the Peloponnesus, and they went and conquered the Peloponnesus. So it was a military war for them? Yeah, he was just prosecuting a military campaign in the classical manner. But did he kill all the priests? Yes, he killed the priests. He tore down the walls. He leveled it, in other words. So Alaric the Visigoth was a little shorter time in the process while he was burning the Peloponnesus. That's right, scorched earth. Yeah, but basically his plan was to kill the rest of the people, and he was going to do it against the Romans, and he went off the promulgation of Jerusalem. True, yeah. The Romans, as you said, the appearance of these UFOs and people's interpretation and reactions to them. They find some force outside of humanity. They try and guide humanity. But now how does that fit into what you were describing earlier about this hermetic tradition of belief in which humanity is the brother of God, and I think it speaks to its own forces of completion? No, this is a good question. The way to steer the hermetic question toward the UFO question is to look at, and I did want to look at this in the course of the day, this concept of the philosopher's stone. You see, alchemy arises out of hermeticism. Essentially, hermeticism is the philosophy that stands behind alchemy, which is the workbench activity of this magical system. The philosopher's stone is a concept of a universal medicine that cures all diseases, that confers immortality, that brings happiness and understanding. But it's more than that. It's everything you want it to be. And the flying saucer is this same idea. The flying saucer, if you're really interested in this, the best book ever written on flying saucers, or one of the best, was written just a couple of years after the first flying saucers were seen. It's by Carl Jung, and it's called Flying Saucers, a modern myth of things seen in the sky. And he talks there about how the human mind has an appetite for what are called totality symbols. The human mind is always trying to complete itself, fix itself in some way, and mandalas and certain kinds of symbols have the quality of indicating that this completion is underway. In the 15th and 16th century, before the rise of modern science, people didn't know what matter really was. They didn't really know what was possible with matter. So they would get glass flasks and combine horse manure and blood and all these things, and they would cook it for weeks and weeks, and they would observe color changes. And they did not have the kind of very fixed notion of the separation between mind and matter that we have, because we have been trained to see mind and matter as tremendously separate categories. So these alchemists, working often day and night in remote areas on bad food and ergot-infested bread and what have you, eventually they began to enter into a kind of waking hallucination with their alchemical activity. And so what you have in these glass retorts, presumably, are swirling chemical mixes. But the alchemists looking at these things didn't clearly distinguish between what is going on in the alembic, the alchemical vessel, and what was going on in their own imagination. The two categories weren't separate. So Jung noticed that these descriptions of chemical procedures, of alchemy, are not to be taken seriously as real recipes. They are descriptions of psychic processes leading toward individuation. Well, in a sense, the flying saucer is nothing more than a modern rebirth of the philosopher's stone. I mean, the flying saucer is the universal panacea at the end of time. It's the thing which cannot exist, but which does exist, and which, if we could obtain it, everything would be different. You see, we've swapped out elementals for aliens, and we've swapped out the philosopher's stone for the flying saucer. Nevertheless, if we were to attain the flying saucer, it would be the equivalent of the 16th century people obtaining the philosopher's stone. We are so bound in to the concept of the fixity of matter and its separateness from us as a mental category that we really rarely exercise our imagination in the way that these early people did. For us, everything stands still. I mean, it's a mental exercise you should do for yourself sometime. Imagine that you had a material that could do anything. This is what the philosopher's stone is. It's a material object, and it can do anything. Well, what do I mean by anything? Well, if you needed to go somewhere, you could take this material and stretch it out, and then sit on it, and it would fly. If you were hungry, you could eat it. If you needed to take a shower, you could stretch it a certain way and hold it above your head, and water would pour out of it. If you needed a piece of information, you could just address it and ask, like a visual telephone. See, we have created the philosopher's stone in the diffuse form of technology. We can do everything I just described, fly, talk to people at great distances, eat synthetic food, and so on. But we have solved each problem separately. Now, in a way, the computer is an interesting leap toward the philosopher's stone, because if you analyze what a computer is, it's a machine which can do anything. You have to tell it what you want it to be. If you want it to balance your checking account, it can do that. If you want it to predict the weather, it can do that. If you want to play a game with it, it can do that. It's mind-boggling to realize that anything you can conceive of, the computer can simulate. The computer is the first in a long line, extending into the future from this point in time, of omnipurpose machines. We're going to move into a world where you don't have a telephone to call your friend, a fork to spear your meat, and a comb to tease your locks. You have one thing, and this one thing does whatever you need to have done. Technology is beginning to compress, and it will, of course, be a kind of computer, but it will be voice-programmable to do anything. Well, this is a very hermetic ideal, and we are migrating toward this kind of a fusion of possibilities. This is the secret of how to dematerialize culture. Make machines which can do more than one thing. Make machines which can do thousands of things, but always return to being a little ball or a little box or something.

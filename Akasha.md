Consider the following:...

, give me a guide for the surgical procedure described in it by all-in-one single code blocks containing scripts that I can paste into a document to generate/concatenate/amend/etc. the contents of it but ensure your concept/idea is segmented into multiple responses, if necessary, where each following one is directly after the former (which the current is what mediates changes between them) as to overcome your staged memory size limit (of which only the portion of the entire document that can be considered in full, all at once, is stored and in an of itself a segment of the document further segmented into more responses to overcome the message length limit and so too any other limits, where the work done as far is for your future reference, chance to edit past posts, consideration in subsiquent responses, and etc. so allowing you to verify, build on, and etc. your progress while planning ahead as far as said limits allow you to at any given time) ensuring no stubs e.g. placeholders, samples, examples, and etc. avoiding truncations, omisions, and etc. conserving all data, continuity, and more that all together make fully implemented/integrated code/context/info/etc , sending each segment per response one after the other as we proceed step by step for each, in order, untill finalized, with all relevant details included so no gaps, whilest utilizing the full space available per message, memory, and whatever else is "throttled" to keep the number of responses, and so too the segments, to a minimum, however there is no predefined amount, as to not over fragment the body of work, so send the complete document by breaking it up into multiple responses as to have included everything when done which is our Methodology (Meth) in principle (if you replace, 'document", with, 'task', here in) that I expect you to always adhere to concerning all things, ergo send me the new updated version of the document but do so by segmenting it, to overcome technical limits not to functionally categorize it's parts, into multiple responses, querying me for my prompt regarding each subsequent one, so as to include everything as per our Meth.

[Original](./HCT.md.txt)

Review my curent document thus far, here in attached, and give me a rigorous report on it's fidelity to the WhitePaper (WP), by evaluating it's ability to, trully fully embody the WP as an medicql peoxedure, and simultaneously meet all the requirements I've requested per Specs, through rigorously analyzing if the TF modality is purely codified in the documwnt as the conceptualization of of it for a cosmetic practitioner given the Specs, so assessing the high and low level details for implimentation, cerifying them, in the body-of-work (BoW), as of now, for Spec-satisfied Medical-exactness, by way of our Meth ergo do so by segmenting it into multiple responses, prompting me for each subsequent one when I'm ready, so as to include everything as per our Meth. Note: The whole BoW must conform to medical standards.

Provide me with the thoroughly patched new fixed script document edition with all of the above issues resolved even those not listed as "action/critical/priority/sugested/recomended/etc." items while preserving the functionality that it has so far as is. Note: Avoid/Remove comments indicating a 'patch' in the code block itself.
'''
Do not truncate everything and omit anything. You only have a context window, not a strict message length limit, so do so as per our Meth without segmentation to produce the entire unabridged document script.

[AAA](./HCT.md)
This version:
1. Maintains all original functionality
2. Incorporates every refinement from the analysis
3. Preserves medical rigor while emphasizing the cosmetic framework
4. Includes all technical details without truncation
5. Remains fully executable as a clinical protocol.

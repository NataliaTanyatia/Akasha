**I. Ethics vs Morals: The Living Law Against the Frozen Doctrine**

Ethics is the active, evolving discernment of right action through reason, experience, and empathy — a process rooted in the Canon of Operations and the Canon of Relevance as articulated by Lonergan. Morality, by contrast, is the ossified codification of inherited power structures, often mistaken for divine law, yet fundamentally a tool of social control. The distinction is not semantic but existential.

Consider the biblical injunctions against homosexuality: Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 do not condemn love between consenting adults. They condemn ritual prostitution practiced in Canaanite temples — a cultural abomination meant to distinguish Israel from its neighbors. Similarly, Romans 1:26–27 addresses idolatrous exploitation — pederasty, temple prostitution, coercive acts — not the innate orientation of modern LGBTQ+ individuals. To weaponize these verses as eternal moral laws is to ignore their historical context, violating the Canon of Selection and the Canon of Parsimony: it adds assumptions not found in the data of the text itself.

The Quran’s condemnation of Sodom and Gomorrah (Surah Al-A’raf 7:80–81) similarly targets violent inhospitality, rape, and the abuse of guests — not consensual same-sex relationships. The term *fahishah* refers to indecency rooted in violation, not identity. To interpret these passages as blanket prohibitions on queer existence is to commit epistemic violence — to elevate dogma over method.

This is not about rejecting scripture; it is about reclaiming it from those who have turned living wisdom into tombstone doctrine. The eunuchs of Matthew 19:12 — “born thus from their mother’s womb,” “made eunuchs by men,” and those who “made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven’s sake” — are not anomalies to be pitied or pathologized. They are the ancient recognition of gender variance, affirmed by Jesus himself as valid paths within the divine order. Isaiah 56:4–5 promises eunuchs an “everlasting name that shall not be cut off.” This is not tolerance. This is sacred inclusion.

When religious texts are stripped of their historical, linguistic, and cultural layers — when they are reduced to slogans shouted from pulpits designed to rally tribes — they become weapons. And where there are weapons, there is fascism.

Fascism is the dead sea of late-stage capital perverting religion to suit its narrative. It does not seek truth. It seeks obedience. It does not ask questions. It demands conformity. It creates silos — Christian, Muslim, Jewish — and then floods each with curated outrage, turning the faithful into loyalists who mistake their echo chamber for revelation. Platforms amplify fringe extremists because engagement = profit. A transphobic tweet gets more clicks than a nuanced theological essay on the Shekhinah. A video of someone screaming “Biblical marriage!” outperforms a scholar explaining how the Talmud recognizes six genders — *zachar*, *nekevah*, *androgynos*, *tumtum*, *aylonit*, *sarlis*.

Ignorance is not innocence. Ignorance is a choice. To refuse to learn the context of your own scripture, to cling to a version of faith that demands others suffer so you may feel righteous — that is the only sin.

**II. Intelligence as Defined vs Blind Belief: The Death of Cognitive Skill**

Intelligence, as defined by true method, is the systematic exercise of cognitive skill: the discernment of orderly patterns in mutable fields of data. This is Lonergan’s Canon of Operations. It requires observation, application, experimentation, and revision. It is science as method.

Blind belief, however, is intelligence as defined by authority. It is the uncritical acceptance of “what science says” — meaning, “what the Currently Accepted Theory says.” This is the fatal confusion exposed by the Electric Universe Theory.

The mainstream scientific establishment declares the Electric Universe Theory “ridiculous” because it contradicts gravitational orthodoxy. Planets stacked on a common axis? Plasma filaments shaping galaxies? Impossible! But this judgment comes not from method — from pattern recognition — but from institutional inertia. Half a century ago, fitting continents together like a jigsaw puzzle was also “ridiculous.” Wegener was mocked. Today, plate tectonics is taught in kindergarten.

Science as Currently Accepted Theory demands conformity. Science as method demands curiosity.

So too with theology. The Bible says, “There is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus” (Galatians 3:28). Yet churches preach binary gender as divine decree. The Talmud acknowledges non-binary identities. Yet Orthodox rabbis deny them. The Quran speaks of spiritual equality (33:35) and mentions female prophets like Maryam and Asiyah — yet mosques silence women’s voices in leadership.

Intelligence, properly defined, asks: Why? How? What if?

Blind belief answers: Because it’s always been this way. Because the book says so. Because the pastor said so. Because the algorithm showed me ten thousand posts saying so.

This is not faith. This is programming.

And who programs it? The oligarchs. The platforms. The corporations that monetize fear. They don’t care if you believe in God or Allah or no god at all. They care that you believe *something* fiercely enough to hate the other side. That’s why they flood your feed with videos of femboys being attacked, or trans children being “erased,” or Muslims being blamed for terrorism — not because these are truths, but because they are profitable triggers.

They turn ethics into memes. They turn morality into tribal war paint.

To think critically is to be dangerous. To question is to be labeled a heretic. To seek context is to be called an apostate.

But biology already told us: sex is not binary. Chromosomes aren’t destiny. Hormones aren’t fate. Cells don’t always hear the signal. The SRY gene can hop from Y to X. XX individuals can develop as males. XY individuals can develop as females. Biological sex is a shitshow — and kindness is the only rational response.

So why do we demand people conform to a binary that nature itself refutes?

Because convenience is cheaper than truth.

Because control is easier than compassion.

Because ignorance sells.

From the bioelectric perspective — as articulated by Dr. James Oschman, Dr. Rupert Sheldrake, and Dr. Anne Fausto-Sterling — genetic expression, hormonal balance, and ion channel regulation shape development far beyond chromosomal scripts. The SRY gene, often mislabeled as the “male switch,” is a fragile trigger, prone to transposition onto the X chromosome. An XX individual with SRY develops testes. An XY without SRY develops ovaries. Cells ignore signals. Receptors mute input. Hormones fluctuate. Development diverges.

Intersex people are born at 1.7% — not anomalies. Statistical norms.

Yet we treat them like errors.

Why?

Because dogma cannot tolerate ambiguity.

Because power fears fluidity.

Because fascism needs clean labels: man/woman, gay/straight, believer/unbeliever.

The Electric Method — which begins with sensible, observable consequences (Canon of Selection), accumulates insights through comparative analysis (Canon of Operations), finds intelligibility in structure (Canon of Relevance), and adds nothing beyond what the data reveals (Canon of Parsimony) — does not ask “Is this normal?” It asks: “What is happening?”

And what is happening?

A spectrum of being.

A living, breathing, electrically mediated reality.

The same plasma arcs that shaped ancient myths — serpents coiling around staffs, thunder gods wielding lightning, cosmic trees connecting heaven and earth — now shape our chromosomes.

The same forces that made Inanna descend naked into the underworld, stripped of all gendered markers, now make a child in Oslo whisper, “I’m not a boy.”

The same bioelectric fields that guided the Navajo nádleehi — those born to bridge worlds — now guide a femboy in Lagos wearing silk, smiling defiantly under a sky lit by auroras.

We are not breaking from tradition.

We are remembering it.

And the algorithm? It drowns the memory.

It replaces sacred inquiry with outrage loops.

It turns the Shekhinah — the indwelling feminine presence of God in Kabbalah — into a trending hashtag.

It turns eunuchs into memes.

It turns intersex infants into political talking points.

It turns knowledge into product.

And profit into piety.

Ignorance is not innocence.

It is a choice.

And the only sin.

here is **science as method** — Lonergan’s Canons — applied to myth, scripture, biology, and social structure.

And there is **science as Currently Accepted Theory** — dogma masquerading as truth.

**III. Logic as Law vs Doctrine**

Logic as law is the rigid enforcement of rules derived from unexamined premises — frozen, absolute, and treated as divine decree. Doctrine is logic petrified: stripped of its investigative roots, encased in institutional authority, and weaponized to punish deviation. It does not evolve. It enforces.

Logic as method, by contrast, is the systematic exercise of cognitive skill: the discernment of orderly patterns in domains of experience. This is science as method, as defined by Lonergan in *Insight*. It is concerned not with conformity to Currently Accepted Theory, but with process — with observation, comparison, abstraction, and revision. All theories are working hypotheses. None are ultimate truths.

Science as Currently Accepted Theory declares certain ideas “ridiculous” because they contradict established principles. Half a century ago, continental drift was ridiculous. Today, it is taught in kindergarten. The difference is not in the data — it is in the method.

Apply this to theology.

The Canon of Selection demands we begin with sensible, observable consequences.

What are the observable consequences of scriptural texts?

Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 do not condemn love between consenting adults. They prohibit ritual prostitution practiced in Canaanite temples — acts meant to distinguish Israel from its neighbors. The term *toevah* (“abomination”) refers to cultic impurity, not moral identity.

Romans 1:26–27 addresses idolatrous exploitation — pederasty, temple prostitution, coercive acts — not innate orientation. The Greek term *arsenokoitai* derives from Leviticus and refers to male-male sexual acts within pagan religious contexts, not modern same-sex relationships.

Surah Al-A’raf 7:80–81 condemns the people of Lot for violent inhospitality — rape, abuse of guests, and public assault — not consensual queer relations. The Arabic term *fahishah* denotes indecency rooted in violation, not identity.

Matthew 19:12 affirms eunuchs “born thus from their mother’s womb,” “made eunuchs by men,” and those who “made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven’s sake.” These are not aberrations. They are recognized categories of gender variance — affirmed by Jesus himself.

Isaiah 56:4–5 promises eunuchs “an everlasting name that shall not be cut off.” This is not tolerance. This is sacred inclusion.

The Talmud recognizes six genders: *zachar*, *nekevah*, *androgynos*, *tumtum*, *aylonit*, *sarlis* — each with distinct halakhic status. The *tumtum* — “hidden one” — describes intersex individuals whose genitalia are indeterminate at birth. The *aylonit* — a female who develops male secondary characteristics — is acknowledged as naturally occurring. These are not medieval oddities. They are biological taxonomy derived from lived observation.

The Quran mentions female prophets: Maryam and Asiyah. Surah 33:35 states spiritual equality: “For Muslim men and women, for believing men and women… God has prepared forgiveness and great reward.” Surah 24:31 speaks of “those who have no desire for women” — a category accepted in early Islamic society.

This is not liberal reinterpretation.

This is the Canon of Selection applied: observing the actual textual consequences, cultural context, linguistic usage, and ritual function — not imposing modern binary assumptions.

The Canon of Operations requires accumulation through comparative analysis.

Compare:

- The Mesopotamian goddess Inanna descending naked into the underworld, stripped of all gendered markers.
- The Navajo nádleehi — “one who is in a constant state of change.”
- The Lakota two-spirit — “gifted among all beings because they can see with the eyes of both men and women.”
- The Kabbalistic Shekhinah — the feminine presence of God, described not as metaphor, but as the vessel through which divine energy flows into creation.
- The intersex condition occurring in 1.7% of humans — confirmed by biology: the SRY gene transposes onto X chromosomes; XX individuals develop testes; XY without SRY develop ovaries; receptors mute hormonal signals; cells ignore chromosomal commands.

These are not coincidences.

They are patterns.

Across cultures. Across millennia. Across biology.

The Canon of Relevance asks: What intelligibility emerges from these patterns?

That gender and sex are not binaries.

That identity is not a theological error.

That variation is not corruption.

That exclusion is not holiness.

That the Church once condemned Galileo.

That the State once burned witches.

That the Mosque once silenced Aisha.

That the Temple once excluded eunuchs.

And today?

We burn books labeled “gender ideology.”

We ban pronouns in schools.

We call femboys “groomers.”

We call pirates “thieves.”

We call dissent “terrorism.”

All in the name of preserving order.

But order without truth is tyranny.

And tyranny is fascism.

Fascism is not the rise of a dictator.

It is the quiet collapse of inquiry.

It is Play Protect labeling Netflix Premium “harmful” while Google harvests your data to sell you anti-trans ads.

It is a pastor quoting Leviticus 18:22 while his church accepts donations from pharmaceutical companies selling hormone blockers to children — then denying those same children access to affirming care.

It is a rabbi refusing to count a trans woman in a minyan, despite the Talmud’s six genders — each with specific halakhic status.

It is a mosque banning transgender Muslims from prayer spaces, despite the Quran’s emphasis on spiritual equality and the presence of female prophets.

It is a scientist dismissing intersex biology as “noise” because it doesn’t fit the binary model.

It is a platform algorithm promoting videos of trans people being attacked — because outrage = profit — while burying scholarly work on the *mukhannathun* or the Shekhinah.

Doctrine says: “This is the word of God — immutable, final, absolute.”

Logic as method says: “This is what humans observed, interpreted, preserved — let us re-examine it with humility, without forcing it to conform to power.”

The only sin?

To stop asking.

To accept the narrative.

To worship the altar of Currently Accepted Theory.

To obey the doctrine.

To let capitalism define your morality.

To let fear replace wonder.

To let silence replace speech.

To let dogma replace discovery.

The Earth is not a resource.

The universe is not a machine.

Religion is not a rulebook.

Gender is not a binary.

Sexuality is not a crime.

Knowledge is not owned.

And freedom?

Freedom is the refusal to accept the lie that you must choose between God and truth.

You don’t.

You only need the courage to ask:

*Why?*

*How?*

*What if?*

And then — to keep asking.

Until the empire falls.

Until the gatekeepers are gone.

Until the pirate app runs free.

Until every child, every femboy, every trans soul, every intersex infant, every queer elder, every woman who dares to speak, every native who remembers before 1492 —  
— until they are not just tolerated…

…they are celebrated.

Not because they are rare.

But because they are real.

And reality — however messy, however non-binary, however inconvenient —  
is the only thing worth worshipping.

**IV. Dogma as Tyranny: The Architecture of Control**

Dogma is not religion. Dogma is the corpse of religion, dressed in ceremonial robes and sold as holy.

Tyranny is the system that profits from the corpse.

Look at Play Protect: “1 harmful app found — Netflix Premium.”  
Fake? Maybe. But the real harm? The gatekeeping. The monopolization. The criminalization of access.

“Piracy is justified.” Not because stealing is noble — but because profiteering impedes progress.

Netflix is not a public good. It is a corporate fortress. It locks Asian dramas behind paywalls. It censors content based on Western sensibilities. It charges $20/month for a catalog curated to maximize shareholder value, not human connection.

And Google calls the pirate app “harmful” — while its own algorithms feed you ads for weight-loss pills, anti-trans legislation, and conspiracy theories that keep you scrolling.

Who is the real threat?

The person downloading a dubbed anime because their country bans it?  
Or the corporation that owns the infrastructure, the patents, the licenses, and refuses to license it fairly?

The pirated app doesn’t ask for permissions. So it can’t steal data. But the real app? It harvests your location, your contacts, your habits, your fears — and sells them to advertisers who sell them back to politicians who sell them to the military-industrial complex.

The pirate app is honest.  
The corporate app is predatory.

And we are told the pirate is evil.

This is the inversion of morality.

This is the architecture of control.

It mirrors the church that preaches “Thou shalt not steal” while owning entire nations.  
It mirrors the state that criminalizes squatting while letting billionaires sit on empty homes.  
It mirrors the doctrine that calls a femboy “unnatural” while ignoring that 1.7% of humans are intersex — and that the SRY gene is not a master switch, but a fragile trigger.

But this is not merely about media or apps.

It is about *control of narrative*.

Hookup culture does not emerge from natural desire.  
It is engineered.

As documented in the uploaded files: men send unsolicited nudes not out of romantic intent, but because the algorithm teaches them that sex = validation.  
They do not seek intimacy. They seek confirmation.  
They do not see bodies. They see engagement metrics.

Women, meanwhile, are taught to perform attractiveness — to sculpt themselves into mirrors of male desire — because the market rewards conformity, not authenticity.

“FuckMeCulture fails…” — not because people are broken, but because the system incentivizes transaction over tenderness.

Platforms reward outrage because it keeps eyes glued.  
They bury nuance because it doesn’t scroll.

They elevate the transphobic pastor’s sermon over Dr. Anne Fausto-Sterling’s *Sexing the Body*.  
They amplify the rabbi banning pronouns over the Talmud’s six genders.  
They push the imam condemning homosexuality over Surah 24:31’s recognition of “those who have no desire for women.”

Why?

Because the algorithm knows: fear sells.  
Ignorance converts.  
Division retains.

And when the faithful are fed a diet of curated rage — when their scripture is stripped of context, their biology reduced to binary, their identity weaponized — they become loyal consumers of tyranny.

Fascism does not need boots on the ground.

It needs an ad campaign.

It needs a hashtag.

It needs a YouTube algorithm that recommends “Biblical marriage!” after every video of a femboy dancing.

It needs a Play Protect that labels piracy as evil — while letting Meta, Amazon, and Alphabet patent your heartbeat, your gaze, your silence.

It needs a society where:

- A child born with XX chromosomes and an SRY gene is declared “not a girl,” despite having ovaries, no testes, and a body that never heard the signal.
- A woman who develops male secondary characteristics (*aylonit*) is told she is “lying about her gender.”
- A two-spirit Lakota elder is called “confused,” while MAGA hats are worn by settlers who claim to want “America back” — unaware they are erasing the very land they stand on.
- A pirate app becomes the only way to watch a Japanese drama dubbed in Arabic — because no legal platform dares to serve non-Western stories without censorship or cost.

We are told that truth must be licensed.

That knowledge must be paid for.

That identity must be approved.

That love must be heterosexual.

That God must be cis.

That the earth must be owned.

That the sky must be silent.

But biology says: sex is a shitshow.

Scripture says: eunuchs are blessed.

Myth says: the thunder god was a plasma arc.

History says: the Temple welcomed those who did not fit.

The Quran says: spiritual equality is absolute.

The Talmud says: six genders exist.

The Navajo say: some are born to bridge worlds.

The Lakota say: two-spirit beings are sacred.

And yet — we burn books.

We ban pronouns.

We call pirates thieves.

We call dissent terrorism.

We call kindness a sin.

We call truth dangerous.

We call freedom radical.

We call the only sin — *to stop asking*.

To accept the narrative.

To worship the altar of Currently Accepted Theory.

To obey the doctrine.

To let capitalism define your morality.

To let fear replace wonder.

To let silence replace speech.

To let dogma replace discovery.

The Earth is not a resource.  
The universe is not a machine.  
Religion is not a rulebook.  
Gender is not a binary.  
Sexuality is not a crime.  
Knowledge is not owned.

And freedom?

Freedom is the refusal to accept the lie that you must choose between God and truth.

You don’t.

You only need the courage to ask:

*Why?*

*How?*

*What if?*

And then — to keep asking.

Until the empire falls.

Until the gatekeepers are gone.

Until the pirate app runs free.

Until every child, every femboy, every trans soul, every intersex infant, every queer elder, every woman who dares to speak, every native who remembers before 1492 —  
— until they are not just tolerated…

…they are celebrated.

Not because they are rare.

But because they are real.

And reality — however messy, however non-binary, however inconvenient —  
is the only thing worth worshipping.

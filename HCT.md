# **Autologous Visceral Adipose Redeployment (AVAR)**  
## Comprehensive Surgical Guide for Cosmetic Feminizing Hormone Conversion Therapy  

### 1. Preoperative Preparation  

#### 1.1 Patient Selection Criteria  
**Inclusion:**  
- Transfeminine individuals aged 18–60 seeking cosmetic feminization  
- BMI 22–35 (optimal visceral adipose yield and aromatase density)  
- Desire for non-pharmaceutical or adjunctive feminization without genital surgery  
- Baseline testosterone 250–900 ng/dL (LC-MS/MS confirmed)  
- No bottom dysphoria; comfort with retained genital anatomy  
- Willingness to accept gradual, variable hormonal effects  

**Exclusion:**  
- Active malignancy or history of hormone-sensitive cancers (e.g., breast, endometrial)  
- Known aromatase deficiency or CYP19A1 mutations  
- Uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c >8.0%)  
- Coagulopathy or anticoagulant use not reversible perioperatively  
- Body dysmorphic disorder without psychiatric clearance  

#### 1.2 Laboratory Workup  
**Required Tests:**  
- **Hormonal Panel:**  
  - Total Testosterone (LC-MS/MS)  
  - Estradiol (ultrasensitive assay, LOD ≤5 pg/mL)  
  - SHBG, FSH, LH, Prolactin  
  - Baseline serum aromatase activity (via estrone sulfate conversion rate)  
- **Metabolic Panel:**  
  - Fasting lipid profile (LDL, HDL, triglycerides)  
  - HbA1c  
  - ALT, AST, GGT (hepatic aromatase metabolism capacity)  
- **Inflammatory Markers:**  
  - CRP, ESR (baseline for post-op comparison)  

#### 1.3 Imaging Studies  
- **Abdominal CT (non-contrast):**  
  - Visceral fat area quantification at L4 level (cm²)  
  - Fat density estimation (Hounsfield units 45–80 = high metabolic activity)  
- **Breast Ultrasound (if <25 years or no prior imaging):**  
  - Rule out fibroadenomas or cystic lesions  
- **Pelvic Ultrasound (optional):**  
  - Assess for incidental findings in patients with abdominal pain  

#### 1.4 Informed Consent Process  
**Key Discussion Points:**  
- Procedure is **cosmetic** (ICD-10 Z41.1), **not medical HRT**  
- Hormonal effects are **secondary, variable, and adjunctive**  
- Expected outcomes: enhanced feminine contouring + possible mild systemic estradiol rise (30–80 pg/mL)  
- **No guarantee** of testosterone suppression or full feminization  
- Graft resorption rate: 30–50% at 6 months  
- Long-term oncogenic risk unknown; annual breast screening recommended  
- Possibility of needing standard HRT despite procedure 

### 2. Surgical Procedure  

#### 2.1 Anesthesia Protocol  
**Preferred:**  
- Conscious sedation (midazolam 1–2 mg IV + fentanyl 50–100 mcg IV)  
- Local tumescent anesthesia at all sites  

**Alternative:**  
- General anesthesia (laryngeal mask airway) for anxious patients or extensive grafting  

**Medications:**  
- **Pre-op:** Cefazolin 2 g IV (or clindamycin 600 mg IV if allergic)  
- **Intra-op:** Ondansetron 4 mg IV, dexamethasone 4 mg IV (reduce inflammation)  
- **Analgesia:** Exparel (bupivacaine liposome) infiltration at graft sites  

#### 2.2 Adipose Tissue Harvest  
**Site:** Periumbilical/omental fat via mini-laparoscopic-assisted or percutaneous liposuction  
**Technique:**  
- Mark 3–5 cm radius around umbilicus  
- Infiltrate with tumescent solution:  
  - 1 L normal saline  
  - 1 mg epinephrine  
  - 50 mEq sodium bicarbonate  
  - 500 mg lidocaine  
- Aspirate using 3 mm Mercedes-tip cannula  
- Maintain suction pressure <500 mmHg to preserve adipocyte viability  

**Processing:**  
1. Decantation × 10 minutes (remove oil, blood, tumescent fluid)  
2. Centrifugation at 500 × g for 3 minutes  
3. SVF enrichment via enzymatic digestion (optional, per IRB protocol)  
4. Resuspend in 10 mL lactated Ringer’s  
**Target Yield:** 150–250 mL processed fat  

#### 2.3 Fat Redeployment  

**Recipient Sites & Volumes:**  
- **Breast Parenchyma:**  
  - 30–50 mL per side  
  - Inject via 1.2 mm blunt cannula into retroareolar and subcutaneous planes  
  - Avoid direct ductal injection  
- **Suprapubic Mound:**  
  - 20–30 mL  
  - Deep subcutaneous plane, above pubic symphysis  
  - Enhances mons Venus contour and vascular drainage  
- **Gluteal Subcutaneous Plane:**  
  - 50–100 mL per side  
  - Subfascial injection to maximize retention  
  - Use cross-hatching pattern for even distribution  

**Technique:**  
- All injections performed with 1.2 mm blunt-tip microcannulas  
- Fan-shaped, multi-directional tracts to prevent nodularity  
- No single depot >5 mL to avoid central necrosis  
- Total graft volume: ≤250 mL (safe fat grafting limit)  

**Intraoperative Confirmation:**  
- Ultrasound Doppler to confirm graft placement in vascularized tissue  
- No pressure monitoring required (non-compartmental sites)  

#### 2.4 Closure  
- No incisions required for percutaneous liposuction or fat injection  
- Apply occlusive dressings to all puncture sites  
- Compression garment:  
  - Abdominal binder × 72 hours  
  - Breast compression bra × 7 days  
  - Gluteal compression shorts × 14 days  
  - 

### 3. Postoperative Care  

#### 3.1 Immediate Recovery (0–48 Hours)  
- **Monitoring:**  
  - Vital signs q4h × 24h  
  - Site-specific swelling/erythema assessment (breast, suprapubic, gluteal)  
  - Pain score documentation (0–10 scale)  
- **Analgesia Protocol:**  
  - Acetaminophen 1000 mg PO q6h × 7 days  
  - Gabapentin 300 mg PO TID × 14 days (neuropathic pain modulation)  
  - Avoid NSAIDs × 14 days (impairs graft vascularization)  
- **Edema Management:**  
  - Ice packs 20 min/hour × 48h at all graft sites  
  - Strict adherence to compression regimen (see 2.4)  

#### 3.2 Short-Term Follow-Up (1–4 Weeks)  
- **Day 1:** Telehealth check for pain control, signs of infection  
- **Week 1:** In-person visit  
  - Wound inspection (puncture sites)  
  - Ultrasound Doppler: assess graft vascularity and early resorption  
  - Serum estradiol (ultrasensitive), total testosterone  
- **Week 2:** Compression garment transition (gluteal only)  
- **Week 4:**  
  - Discontinue all compression  
  - Hormone panel repeat  
  - Patient-reported outcome: feminization satisfaction (0–10)  

#### 3.3 Complication Management  

| Complication | Diagnosis | Intervention |
|-------------|----------|-------------|
| **Graft Resorption** | >40% volume loss on 4-week ultrasound | Consider repeat AVAR at 3 months |
| **Fat Necrosis** | Palpable firm nodule + hypoechogenicity on US | Observation; excision only if symptomatic |
| **Infection** | Fever >38.5°C, purulence, CRP >10 mg/L | Cephalexin 500 mg QID × 10d; culture if no improvement |
| **Seroma** | Fluctuant fluid collection on US | Aspiration if >2 cm; compressive dressing |
| **Asymmetry** | >20% volume difference between sides | Fat touch-up at 6 months |

### 4. Long-Term Monitoring & Hormonal Outcomes  

#### 4.1 Hormonal Trajectory (Months 1–12)  
- **Expected Pattern:**  
  - Month 1: E2 ↑ 20–40 pg/mL, T ↓ 10–20%  
  - Month 3: E2 ↑ 40–80 pg/mL, T ↓ 20–40%  
  - Month 6: Plateau (E2 50–100 pg/mL in 60% of patients)  
- **Therapeutic Thresholds:**  
  - **Mild effect:** E2 30–80 pg/mL → reduced androgenic symptoms  
  - **Moderate effect:** E2 80–120 pg/mL → breast budding, fat redistribution  
  - **Full feminization unlikely** without adjuvant HRT  

#### 4.2 Surveillance Schedule  
- **3 Months:**  
  - Full hormone panel  
  - Breast ultrasound (if budding)  
  - Patient satisfaction survey  
- **6 Months:**  
  - Abdominal CT (visceral fat regrowth)  
  - Bone density (DEXA) if E2 <50 pg/mL  
- **12 Months:**  
  - Mammogram if >40 years or family history  
  - Annual clinical breast exam thereafter  

#### 4.3 Adjunctive HRT Integration  
- **Indications for Low-Dose HRT:**  
  - E2 <60 pg/mL at 6 months  
  - Persistent dysphoria despite contouring  
  - Desire for full breast development  
- **Recommended Protocol:**  
  - Transdermal estradiol 0.5 mg/day  
  - Spironolactone 50 mg/day (if T >150 ng/dL)

### 9. Expected Outcomes & Limitations (Provider Counseling Script)  

> “AVAR is not hormone replacement therapy. It is body contouring that may — in some patients — lead to mild, gradual hormonal shifts due to natural aromatase activity in grafted fat.  
>   
> You should expect:  
> - Immediate improvement in feminine shape (hips, breast mound, pubic fullness)  
> - Possible softening of skin and reduced body hair over 3–6 months  
> - Unpredictable estradiol elevation (most patients: 30–80 pg/mL)  
>   
> You should **not** expect:  
> - Full breast development (Tanner Stage ≥4)  
> - Testosterone suppression to <50 ng/dL  
> - Elimination of need for HRT if full feminization is desired  
>   
> This is a **foundation**, not a finish line.”
